JAPsupplies0.t;The Disaster in Kyushu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies0.d;Hyuga has been hit hard by typhoons this summer, yet the king of Kyushu seems to be just fine letting the peasants die. The Sangiin of Merchants have decided that we might have to intervene to save the peasants. While this may be technically interfering in the business of our overlords, what harm could a fleet of rice do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies1.t;The Disaster in Kyushu;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies1.d;A flurry of reports come from the port of Kagoshima. First, it indicated that the merchant confederation in the southerly isles of Sainantan have sent us a ship of grain to mitigate our severe typhoon season. Then, news came that the samurai bureaucrats of the port and the Sainantan merchants came to a brawl. Next, a Samurai had struck down a merchant with his rights of Kiri-sute gomen for insolence. Finally, there was a battle between the fleets sailors and the port garrison, and our garrison seem to have lost to their superior weapons? \n\n Quick dialogue between cooler heads have stopped this from leading to an acutal war, but the news has shocked the kingdom. How could have a mob of merchants beaten true Samurai? Do we have to take a look into their weapons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
