cop_ita_NAME;Khaamic International Technical Association;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_ita_DESC;The government sponsored many diplomatic missions to seek out technical expertise throughout Europe during the 1840's, which involved university visits and diplomatic manoeuvres to gain approval from the great powers. However, they have all made it clear that they want to be the sole power to assist Khemet in it's modernisation, and that any hint of collaboration with other major powers would see their government recall all technicians from Khemet. The question remains, who do we approach for assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
egy_ita_title;Khaamic International Technical Association.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
egy_ita_desc;Founded in 1843, the Association was a government sponsored initiative to attract modern talent to the rapidly modernising state. Not only did many Egyptians seek education elsewhere, such as Ali Mubarak, philosophers, technicians and doctors came to the country as well, funded by the government, with aims of modernising the state. However, the great powers took this opportunity to slightly increase their influence in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
establish_the_syneisfora_title;Establish the Syneisfora;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
establish_the_syneisfora_desc;Military duty in Khemet was usually based on levies by the monarch, who has grown weaker as the adoption of western government has done away with absolutist rule. This was changed with the Syneisfora decree of 1856, which established a 12 month  conscription obligation to all males between 15 and 50. While unpopular among those who were forced to serve, it would prove incredibly effective in the coming Nubian wars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
nile_irrigation_title;Irrigation of the Nile;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
nile_irrigation_desc;In order to secure a boost in revenue, The king tasked the ITA with bringing traditional farming up to speed with the west. With the recent acquisition of coalfields in Lebanon, the transition from oxen to steam power could begin. Land was redistributed and the fellah system was tweaked so that farmers had the option to pay 1/3 less tax if it was provided in the form of cash crops like sugar and cotton. Within ten years, the standard of living for the average farmer increased twofold, although the impact of this was reduced slightly by inflation, and Khemet rose to become the worlds 3rd largest exporter of cotton and 6th largest exporter of textiles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
ita_charter_title;Alexandria Charter of 1856;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
ita_charter_desc;The ITA not only brought technical competence to the Nile, it also applied this knowledge practically. Government sponsored Industrialisation began in the 1840's but this was extremely slow, expensive and ironically couldn't compete with the vast labour pool of Cairo and Alexandria. This is why the ITA was granted a 5 year charter for a small quarter in Alexandria's harbour, utilising government investment to construct A shipyard, steel mill and a textile factory. Local residents who previously made a living from crafts and weaves were forced into the factories or enticed with promises of riches, but the success of Alexandria's industrial sector effectively killed small business in the city, shifting the sector towards Cairo, which many local artisans immigrated to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
founding_syntechnia_title;Found Syntechnia Archigos;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
founding_syntechnia_desc;As Khemet opened up to western markets under the supervision of the ITA, many Greek merchants began to take advantage of the growing technical sector. After the 1856 charter, the factory owners gradually became wealthy enough to outright purchase the factories from the ITA, which didn't really want them at that point as their focus was on R&D. Inspired by the companies of the west, the factory owners, called archigos, formed Syntechnia, with a focus on construction and heavy machinery. They purchased their own charter in Alexandria and soon became Khemet's number one employer after the crown itself. Their sheer size and wide labour pool eventually paved the way for Khaamic economic dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
avenge_the_betrayal_title;Avenge the Betrayal;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
avenge_the_betrayal_desc;Centuries ago, we were promised spoils and land in the levant as rewards for fighting agains the Muslim horde, and instead we were left with a rump state on the nile while the Italians and French gobbled up coastal cities for themselves. Even then their efforts were useless as a mere 40 years later Khemet fell again and had to liberate itself painfully alone for nearly a century.  Venetian domination of the Mediterranean appears to have reached its zenith and any moment now they should begin to decline. We should seek to be the catalyst for that and further our assertion of dominance over the Levant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
the_great_proclamation_title;The Great Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
the_great_proclamation_desc;As the only independent and powerful Christian state in the Middle East, we are expected by the rest of the Orthodox world to protect our subjects, and liberate them from any mistreatment by the Muslim powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
sursock_and_brothers_title;Sursock and Brothers;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
sursock_and_brothers_desc;Originating from Beirut, the Greek Sursocks amassed great wealth from the Oriental trade and taxing the most fertile of lands in the Levant. This makes them key to the governments plans of developing the region. By "suggesting" that they donate their properties to the government, only to then run them as state-backed administrators, we can assure that their wealth is not misplaced. Their most prominent firm, Sursock and Brothers, has key assets in Beirut, as well as expertise in Banking, will serve well in the hands of the ITA.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
the_anaptyxi_title;The Anaptyxi;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
the_anaptyxi_desc;Many factors contributed to the sudden and massive growth seen in Levantine cities during the second half of the 19th century, with heavy investment from both the ITA, Sursock family and many European entrepreneurs, as well as containing natural resources that Khemet coveted so dearly, but the creation of the Beirut Shipping Company solidified 10 years of economic growth that saw the regions economy quadruple in size.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
pharaonism_title;Embrace Pharaonism;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
pharaonism_desc;The increasing pressure put on Khemet from both Western and Eastern powers has caused a revival of interest into Khemet's past. Both Arabs and Greeks alike are slowly beginning to form national identities, one that revolves around the Nile. Pharaonists look towards the great architectural wonders of the past such as the Great Pyramids as examples of the exemplary Egyptian identity. Ignoring the abundance of slavery and tyrrany, this movement does help to bolster the divided nation, and adopting a much more Egyptian theme to the government would increase its popularity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
hellenic_cradle_title;Hellenic Cradle;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
hellenic_cradle_desc;Greek influence in Khemet stems from the era of Alexander, and has persisted to the point where up until recently they practically ruled the Nile alone. This has resulted in a persistent Hellenic culture that draws jealousy from Greeks across the Mediterranean. As a result Alexandria appears to be the centre of the Greek world, not Athens, and must take the burden of uniting the Mesogeiakós.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
organic_law_title;The Organic Law;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
organic_law_desc;Ali Mubarak was a Muslim minister of education, the first Muslim to hold any power in government since the 15th Century, recently emancipated by loosening of restrictions on Muslims. Growing up surrounded by poverty, his aims were to uplift the impoverished people of the Nile through education and public works. He increased the availability of textbooks and established printing workshops aimed to translate books from Greek to Arabic, which had the unintended effect of creating a much more Bilingual state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
school_of_business_title;Rakoti School of Business and Commerce;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
school_of_business_desc;Scholí Epicheiríseon Emporíou (or SEE) was founded in the mid 19th century as part of an initiative to promote local business and connect to the global market without destroying Khaamic Industry. The many Egyptians who were trained here would go on to create large-multinational companies that also brought expertise back to Khemet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
claim_the_nile_title;Claim the Nile;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
claim_the_nile_desc;The southern border is unstable and potentially hostile, as the assertive Nubians are shifting more and more attention to their north. Only Khemet should rule the Nile, and with it comes the conquest of Sudan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
dual_provisions_title;Issue the Dual Provision;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
dual_provisions_desc;The dual provisions was law that extended the same Pharaonic rights seen in lower Egypt, to the people of the Nile that were recently integrated. In particular, Khartoum and Dongola would also be given local administrative powers to lessen the burden of administrating so far from the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
proothisi_title;Proóthisi!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
proothisi_desc;The winds of revolution in Europe have spilled over into Khemet, and no longer is it accepted by the population for one man to wield the state's power. The protestors have taken up the slogan Proóthisi, shortened from Proóthisi tis Kyvérnisis (Advancement of the Government) which has made it clear to many in government that the king can no longer hold all the power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
law_on_property_title;Law on Property;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
law_on_property_desc;The 1850's saw increasing pressure from both the west and internally to abolish slavery in the country, to the point where a national petition signed by  400,000 people was presented to the government. After 1 week of deliberation, they announced both the abolishment of slavery and protection for those under 16 from manual labour, much to the annoyance of the gentry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
establish_the_egyptian_railways_title;Ethnikós Sidiródromos;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
establish_the_egyptian_railways_desc;Khemet has always been a keen implementer of western ideas, ever since the growth of Scottish and Hungarian industry. While she has been unable to secure any level of stability or even monetary independence in the past, the 19th century saw wonders for Khaamic industry and most importantly, infrastructure. The development of a national railway began in the 1850's, and by 1900, they had one of the hughest railways per km in the whole world. The first line opened in 1852, connecting the Capital, Rakoti, to Ti-Kash-Roomi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
egy_andeno_expedition_title;The Andeno Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
egy_andeno_expedition_desc;While Khemet has rapidly industrialised and, in many cases, surpassed existing industrial bases elsewhere, Khaamic industry suffers from high import costs and lack of local resources, hampering our ability to compete with western output. With this in mind we must seek natural resources elsewhere in the rich lands of India, before the rest of the continent is gobbled up. The chief of navy, Eleftherios Andeno has approached the king asking to take advantage of the weakened Maratha Confederation and to increase Khaamic influence in the area by purchasing one of the few unclaimed ports. The Port of Bombay in particular is large, well fortified and has access to the rich resources of the mainland, which suits our goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_andeno_TITLE;The Andeno Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_andeno_DESC;"The waters were calm, the port was busy, boats floated in and out of the harbour. A simple day was not what it seemed for the seas soon turned to wrath. Mountains rose from the waters puffing dark clouds, polluting the blue skies. Soon their shadows would smother Bombay, and perhaps the world". A large fleet hailing from Khemet arrived in Bombay, demanding an audience with the king. The man who appears to lead the armada has presented an offer from the Nile. They ask to purchase the port of Bombay be transferred to the Khaamic conquerors and that they be granted discounted trading rights on raw materials like iron and coal. Should we refuse they may return with a larger fleet and more sinister intentions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_andeno_success_TITLE;Success of the Andeno Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_andeno_success_DESC;Andeno has returned with great news, the locals have submitted to Khaamic rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_andeno_failure_TITLE;Failure of the Andeno Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_andeno_failure_DESC;Andeno has returned with terrible news, the locals have refused Khaamic rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_royal_sea_lanes_title;The Royal Sea Lanes;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_royal_sea_lanes_desc;Khaamic rulers tended to keep naval expenses low, thus whatever little funding the admiralty got went to coastal protection, spurring a sentiment in the admiralty that waters controlled by the navy is the property of the kingdom, and thus must lead to Rakoti. With the increasing globalisation of trade, Khemet must look across the mediterannean to protect its trade and ensure exports are efficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_desmevmenos_event_TITLE;Desmevménos;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_desmevmenos_event_DESC;The 'Commitment' refers to a period in Khaamic naval history that denotes a lack of funding, and commitment to the ground forces against encroaching powers, like the ottomans. As a result, our naval ambitions must be severely scaled back until we can afford to reform the navy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_sieze_the_levant_title;Sieze the Klemméni;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_sieze_the_levant_desc;Those dastardly Venetians stole our promised lands all those years ago in a bloody and pointless crusade that only served to leech wealth from the Orient into the Adriatic. Their lands around the Sinai are of strategic value too as it gives them easy access to their lands beyond. While theyre wrapped up in a little war, we can sieze the opportunity and take back their lands for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_siezing_the_levant_TITLE;Khemet siezes the Levant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_siezing_the_levant_DESC;While we were distracted, the Copts have stolen our possessions in the levant!
cop_epektasi_neron_title;Epéktasi Nerón;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
cop_epektasi_neron_desc;Epéktasi refers to the policy khaamic rulers endeavoured as Coptic naval power grew, Khaamic kings saw strategic islands such as cyprus and rhodes as key players in the game of the eastern Mediterranean. Zealous as Khemet was about its royal waters, only mild success was seen in this theatre, with raids proving more and more that they may as well own all the islands themselves. Khemet also saught to expand its naval infrastructure, with bases and shipyards, eventually trade hubs that profited from Khaamic industrial strength, all over the Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
