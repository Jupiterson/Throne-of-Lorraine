xhosaprophet6_title;The bride;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
xhosaprophet6_desc;The wedding had been planned for months. Some people opposed the idea of King Sandile marrying the prophet, calling it a simple power grab, while the chief states tthat it was the prophet's idea in the first place.

EVTDESC49517;The death of Fanomezantsoa, the chief of Arbota, made his fragile chiefdom descend in a spiral of chaos as his sons, Mzila and Mawewe, fight for the throne. Soshangane's armies, that once overran the Portuguese settlements at Delagoa Bay, Inhambane and Sena, now turn their gaze inwards as the chiefdom slowly edges towards civil war. It goes without saying that this represents an optimal opportunity to take some of these lands back, and several individuals in the colonies already began to take advantage of this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Rharhabe, the current ruling faction, who have put the chief's favoured wife, the queen regent, in power. The Gcaleka, the main opposition to the Rulers. They claim that the Rharhabe have been too soft on the foreigners, and that the Rharhabe are too weak to bring Xhosa to greatness. The Ndlambe.

ORA_HBR_vict_title;Collapse of the Xhosa;x
ORA_HBR_vict_desc;The Xhosa scum has been beaten for good. After Hibernian intervention on our side, the heathen Xhosa king, quickly overwhelmed by our combined forces has unconditionally surrendered to us. Total victory has been achieved and the Xhosas will no longer endanger either us or the Fenians!;x

HBR_vict_title;Collapse of the Xhosa;x
HBR_vict_desc;The Xhosa have been no match for the combined forces of ours and Drummond. As promised territorial concessions have been granted to us and a sense of calm has been restored. With this the future of our young nation must be decided.;x
HBR_vict_option1;Godspeed!;
HBR_meeting_title;A meeting in Conchobar;x
HBR_meeting_desc;The Xhosa war has concluded and our young nation has entered a time of relative peace, although with its future uncertain. Thus, representatives of the Pharlaimint have met in Conchobar to discuss the future of our nation. Many vital questions and choices are at stake so we must choose carefully.;x
HBR_meeting_option1;Let the meeting begin!;x
HBR_social_title;The Social Reform;x
HBR_social_desc;One of the first issues to be discussed at the meeting were social reforms. One half of the representatives advocated for implementation of an education system, pointing out that for a nation to develop it's citizens need to be well educated. The other half advocated for better health coverage, pointing out that a modern nation cannot function properly without providing basic medical treatment to all citizens. While there was a substantial group of representatives advocating for both, the issue at stake were funds so therefore it was decided that...;x
HBR_social_option1;Our children need education!;x
HBR_social_option2;Our people lack healthcare!;x
HBR_drummond_title;Dreams of Oceania;x
HBR_drummond_desc;Although of Scottish descent, the Drummonders have always been friendly with us throughout our short history. Having allied against the Xhosa during the Frontier War, some of our representatives, called Oceaniates, advocated for further cooperation. They proposed an idea yet unheard of, an utopian like nation state of Caledonian Scots and Fenians where all can prosper based on the fundamental idea of liberty. The groundwork has already started being layed and it's on the Pharlaimint to decide the course of action.;x 
HBR_drummond_option1;We must realize the Oceanian Dream!;x
HBR_drummond_option2;We shall tend to ourselves.;x
HBR_gov_title;The Government Reform;x
HBR_gov_desc;As the last point of discussion the representatives discussed the matters of governance. Throughout our short history we've been ruled by the de facto "president" and general Cathaoir Murchu with unlimited power. It was a temporary solution in order for the state to survive in a harsh environment although this is no longer the case. Now we are able to write a new constitution and install a true democracy while simultaneously attracting european settlers to our free nation!;x
HBR_gov_option1;The people have spoken!;x

ORA_start_desc;Our republic, born out of pioneers brave enough to venture into the unknown, brave enough to face the hardships of leaving what we know, into the isolation of our new home, brave enough to face those who might tread on our independence. Our border to the east has always been one of tension and unease, defined by the Great Kariega, but our hand has been forced, and to war we must go. It is of greatest importance to our survival that we beat the Xhosa and their heathen king, but under the leadership of our great president, Morven Stewart, we shall succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;

ORA_response_title;The Demands from Heidtoun;;;;;;;;;;;;
ORA_response_desc;The highly controversial matter in Rubha Ùr regarding our integration into the scottish colony has sparked serious outrage. Local militias such as the "Caledonian Front" started organising and causing chaos in the colony yearning for an independent Caledonia. Today, a few weeks later, the powers in Heidtoun have sent an outrageous demand of our annexation to the New Rubha colony. We won't tolerate this and shall therefore fight for a free Caledonia!;;;;;;;;;;;;

SHO_start_title;An Empire of Empty Promises;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHO_start_desc;The Second Vatsonga Empire, as it has been called, has little to do with the Tsonga of old, which are all but extinct and assimilated into the modern Tsonga population. The empire has been built in less than a decade, not because of its impressive military, great leadership, or strong economy. It was built by the desperation of its people, being surrounded on all sides by powerful enemies, with no unity, being fed lies by an ambitious clan who happened to be in the right place at the right time. But now, the empire of empty promises is facing the consequences of its actions. It has no proper systems to gain wealth from its people, no methods of dealing with the new waves of bantus, no ways of dealing with foreign powers meddling with its politics, and no ways of paying its leaders their fair due. We must act fast if Tsonga is to survive, or we will simply be a distant memory of a worse time.;;;;;;;;;;;;

litema_start_title;Litema Mural Art;;;;;;;;;;;;
litema_start_desc;Litema, also spelled as ditema, is a form of Sotho mural art composed of decorative and symbolic geometric patterns, commonly associated with Sesotho and Sepedi tradition practised in Basotho and Bapedi. Women create litema on the outer walls and inside of homes by means of engraving, painting, relief mouldings and mosaic. Typically, the geometric patterns are combed or scratched into the wet top layer of fresh clay and dung plaster of the wall, and later painted with earth ochers. Patterns most often mimic ploughed fields through a combed texture, or the patterns refer to plant life, and more occasionally to other aspects of the natural world, such as referring to a clan totem animal. It is common for women of an entire village to apply litema on such special occasions as a wedding or a religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;
