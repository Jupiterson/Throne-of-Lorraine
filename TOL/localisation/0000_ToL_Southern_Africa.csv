xhosaprophet6_title;The bride;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
xhosaprophet6_desc;The wedding had been planned for months. Some people opposed the idea of King Sandile marrying the prophet, calling it a simple power grab, while the chief states tthat it was the prophet's idea in the first place.

EVTDESC49517;The death of Fanomezantsoa, the chief of Arbota, made his fragile chiefdom descend in a spiral of chaos as his sons, Mzila and Mawewe, fight for the throne. Soshangane's armies, that once overran the Portuguese settlements at Delagoa Bay, Inhambane and Sena, now turn their gaze inwards as the chiefdom slowly edges towards civil war. It goes without saying that this represents an optimal opportunity to take some of these lands back, and several individuals in the colonies already began to take advantage of this situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Rharhabe, the current ruling faction, who have put the chief's favoured wife, the queen regent, in power. The Gcaleka, the main opposition to the Rulers. They claim that the Rharhabe have been too soft on the foreigners, and that the Rharhabe are too weak to bring Xhosa to greatness. The Ndlambe.

SHO_start_title;An Empire of Empty Promises;;;;;;;;;;;;
SHO_start_desc;The Second Vatsonga Empire, as it has been called, has little to do with the Tsonga of old, which are all but extinct and assimilated into the modern Tsonga population. The empire has been built in less than a decade, not because of its impressive military, great leadership, or strong economy. It was built by the desperation of its people, being surrounded on all sides by powerful enemies, with no unity, being fed lies by an ambitious clan who happened to be in the right place at the right time. But now, the empire of empty promises is facing the consequences of its actions. It has no proper systems to gain wealth from its people, no methods of dealing with the new waves of bantus, no ways of dealing with foreign powers meddling with its politics, and no ways of paying its leaders their fair due. We must act fast if Tsonga is to survive, or we will simply be a distant memory of a worse time.;;;;;;;;;;;;

litema_start_title;Litema Mural Art;;;;;;;;;;;;
litema_start_desc;Litema, also spelled as ditema, is a form of Sotho mural art composed of decorative and symbolic geometric patterns, commonly associated with Sesotho and Sepedi tradition practised in Basotho and Bapedi. Women create litema on the outer walls and inside of homes by means of engraving, painting, relief mouldings and mosaic. Typically, the geometric patterns are combed or scratched into the wet top layer of fresh clay and dung plaster of the wall, and later painted with earth ochers. Patterns most often mimic ploughed fields through a combed texture, or the patterns refer to plant life, and more occasionally to other aspects of the natural world, such as referring to a clan totem animal. It is common for women of an entire village to apply litema on such special occasions as a wedding or a religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;

litema_birth_desc;The change has been gradual, but noticeable. Litema mural art has evolved past the point of showing just vague concepts, such as marriage or birth, but is now being used to tally crop yields and weapons, display stories and conversations, and even tell jokes. Litema, at least for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$, is not just an art form, it is a syllabary. How this will effect our future, we are yet to know, but it can only be positive.;;;;;;;;;;;;
