the_bantu_empire_desc;Massive instability and bad decisions by our King are causing immense instability and turmoil in our great Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;

LUNDAKINGDIESNEUT;Today, 1 February 1843, Rand the First has died of a terrible pneumonia, leaving his brother, to be named Jaim IX, the throne of the great Kingdom of Lunda. He is ambitious, and craves to reunite all South Babantuan peoples, for that he is very aggressive towards the Babantu Empire, and is too blind to see that a war against them would mean the dismantlement of our great nation. Do we depose him, or do we let Lunda become the Empire we have always needed?;;;;;;;;;;;;
KONGOAGAINSTPYGMY;The so-called Pygmy peoples have been our slaves for centuries, but communities of freed slaves have settled in our borders, mainly in our border with Loango which also have struggles controlling the border. After some months of intense demonstrations, our border guards have mutinied, probably due to the stress of continuously putting down rebellions in the territory. The Pygmies which are now in an open rebellion rally for a new Dynasty with the Pygmies at the head of government: A Pygmy King, which would mean the deposure of our great leader, and conflicts with our territorial integrity, our existance even. Our culture is at strike today.;;;;;;;;;;;;
RATASTABANTUDIES;Ratasta II died today at the palace in Yutu of a heart attack, probably for all the attrocities he committed. Regardless, he has modernized our military, and stopped the Christians from controlling our realm. Now our people can finally rest in peace. Or not? There are 2 princes in line to power, and the king didn't prepare an heir, deeming probable a war of succession. We can, of course, choose now, and ignore any protests that could happen due to it, as our huge populace is also pretty divided on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;
LUNDAKINGDIESSUCCESSION;Our horrendous decision of not letting the successor get its throne has started unrest in our country, and Jaim IX is using this unrest to take over the throne. We may not live to see tomorrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;
YEKEWINS;After a war against the infamous Lundans and their corrupt regime, we have returned peace to the region, and will now reunite our people under our iron fist. Long live Yeke!;;;;;;;;;;;;
FUALRUMEREBELS;Today members of an underground organization in Fualrume have contacted us with the next proposal: the annexion of the territories populated by our brothers. Regardless of support they will rebel against the Babantuan central government, but they offer us the annexion of their controlled territory if we support them.;;;;;;;;;;;;
FUELROMANSTARTSSUPPORT;Today Southern Babantuan rebels have taken Fualrume, Kasarzi and Bunkeya, out of nowhere, without any traces. This has to be work of those pesky Yekes. Regardless, the south of our Empire is rebelling, and we have to do something about it, or our credibility will be tarnished.;;;;;;;;;;;;
FUELROMANSTARTS;Today Southern Babantuan rebels have taken Fualrume, Kasarzi and Bunkeya, out of nowhere, without major resistance. What we know is that at least it's not the work of Yeke, who stays neutral regarding this rebellion. Regardless, the south of our Empire is rebelling, and we have to do something about it, or our credibility will be tarnished.;;;;;;;;;;;;
FUALROMEISAGOODBOY;After the Fualruman Rebellion succeding, we have to be honest and become a part of Yeke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

NYANZANSUNITE;Lately a new sentiment has been growing among our working population: pan-Nyanzanism. This movement aims to create a state that unifies Lake Nyanza and its surroundings, along with the ethnic groups native to the area. This ideology can cause us a lot of problems in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MBARARAFULLSTOP;After winning the war against those who were our brothers, in this false peace we must reclaim our possession of the whole shore of Lake Nyanza, and gain control of it is our destiny. To achieve this destination, we must control the port of Mbarara, controlled by external powers. For Nyanza!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NYANZANWAR;Today, in such a rapid movement that our population in the area could not send anyone to alert the military, groups of according to the perpetrators, "Nyanzans" attacked our naval base in our islands in the lake and sent us back to the mainland, with no time to react with a defense in conditions to resist such attack. May god be with us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MBARARAFULLSTOPBTU;Today 12 sailors of our small but great navy in Ukerewe have been killed by indigenous people, in the port of Mbarara. We can ask for reparations to the Nyanzans, or just give in to the probable Nyanzan demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MBARARAFULLSTOPBTUWHA;Basically: the Babantuans don't care. They have ignored completely the massacre and will continue living easy. To make our demands visible, we could just make us visibly the culprits of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MBARARAFULLSTOPUNCOVERED;Nyanza just publicly reported their support to the massacre, and their party in it. We must retaliate to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MBARARAFULLSTOPGIVENIN;After seeing that we probably intervened in the massacre due to the low budget of it, they got scared and just gave in. This is a great day for the Nyanzan people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MBARARAFULLSTOPREPS;After discovering our party in the massacre, they are now demading reparations for the 12 deaths and estructural damage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COOPERATIONBABANTUSCARE;Yeke and Nyanza have a common enemy: the Babantu. Both our peoples and claims are in that treacherous empire which doesn't care for human rights or even their own brothers. Now, with our surroundings conquered, we can send a diplomatic mission to box the Babantu together and reunite our people once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
COOPERATIONBABANTUMARK;Yeke and Nyanza have a common enemy: the Babantu. Both our peoples and claims are in that treacherous empire which doesn't care for human rights or even their own brothers.

JESUITSOCIALUNREST;Today unrest has grown up in Madingou to a point of no return. The streets are being cluttered by angry Jesuites, which for what they say we aren't respecting their rights, and want to join a Jesuite state. We have to stop this as fast as possible or we'll lose the precious city of Madingou.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JESUITSOCIALUNRESTGAB;Today unrest has grown up in Madingou to a point of no return. The streets are being cluttered by angry Jesuites, which for what they say Loango isn't respecting their rights, and want to join our great Jesuite state. The response of the governmeent in Kinshasa has been enter the city with their military, which without any direct control over Kinshasa due to the rebels cutting communications, have committed multiple attrocities in the beautiful city of Madingou. We must stop this nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JESUITSOCIALUNRESTLOA;The Jesuits have asked for help to their cousins, the Gabonese, and now ask for impossible demands. We could pay reparations and pray for them to not say it isn't enough, completely reform or go to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THELOANGOPLANBTU;The Loango Plan is a plan to partition Loango east-west between the Congo and us, and would give us the high-Babantu-populated territories in Loango, which include Saurimo. This could be excellent to project power over the Congo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
