no_schools_desc;There's no organized school system or budget for education. The scarce literacy gain that is achieved comes from religious schools or it is based on informal community teaching, though these places get some funding, indirectly, from the government. Higher education institutions are either non existent or completely religious and medieval.\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%. If it is 50%, funding needs to be at least 20%. If it is 75%, funding needs to be at least 30%. Otherwise literacy will start to fall.§W;;;;;;;;;;;;
low_schools_desc;A rudimentary school system exists in the capital and a few important cities but enrollment is completely optional. Schools limits themselves to teaching pupils how to read and write. There's no government agency to inspect schools and they have no common standards for teaching, with the few courses that exist being overcrowded. Private schools are commonly in the same conditions. Teachers don't have professional formation and are often just literate men, while pupils often leave school without being properly schooled.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 30%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

acceptable_schools_desc;Schools can be found in every major and most of the medium cities. A government agency exists to ensure quality standards in education and to inspect that proper facilities are used for it. Enrollment is encouraged and sometimes it's outright mandatory, but it's not properly enforced and pupils often don't go to school for a variety of reasons. Children are also taught math and a few other subjects. Education institutions for teenagers are starting to appear, and secular, higher education institutions for adults are common. Teachers are formally trained, but oftentimes poorly.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 40%.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

good_schools_desc;Schools can be found in almost every city. Government agencies take education with the utmost seriousness, and enrollment is mandatory and tightly controlled. Children and teenagers are taught a variety of subjects besides reading and writing and teachers are taught pedagogy during their formation. Literacy campaigns for adults and the elderly are a part of the government's effort to eradicate illiteracy. Higher education institutions are considered good, with opportunities for the poor classes to enroll.\n§YFor the full effects of this reform, your education spending should be at least 50%.\nA fully funded education provides a bonus to this reform.§W\n§RIf average literacy is more than 25%, education funding needs to be more than 10%.

synthetic_sulphur_factory_desc;Ammonia was first manufactured using the Haber process on an industrial scale in 1913 in BASF's Oppau plant in Germany, reaching 20 tonnes per day the following year. During World War I, the production of munitions required large amounts of nitrate. The Allies had access to large sodium nitrate deposits in Chile controlled by British companies. Germany had no such resources, so the Haber process proved essential to the German war effort. Synthetic ammonia from the Haber process was used for the production of nitric acid, a precursor to the nitrates used in explosives.;;;;;;;;;;;;
liquor_distillery_desc;The continuous still allowed the alcohol industry to reach new levels of productivity. The still consists of a first column (called the analyzer) in a column still that has steam rising and wash descending through several levels. The second column (called the rectifier) carries the alcohol from the wash, where it circulates until it can condense at the required strength. It behaves like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. The tube is filled with either porous packing or bubble plates. The rising vapor, starts to condense in the cooler, higher level of the column.;;;;;;;;;;;;
