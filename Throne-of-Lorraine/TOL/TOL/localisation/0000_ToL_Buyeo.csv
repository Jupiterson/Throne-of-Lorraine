reign_of_the_yongping_emperor_title;Reign of the Yongping Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
reign_of_the_yongping_emperor_desc;Ascending to the throne in 1860 at the age of 18, the young Yongping Emperor was significantly influenced by his tutors, many of which originated from the Silhak school of thought in late-Buyeo Korea. A staunch supporter of modernization across the Buyeo Empire, his ascension marks the beginning of a new age of modernity in our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
modernize_the_northern_armies_title;Modernize the Northern Armies;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
modernize_the_northern_armies_desc;Our recent confrontations with the Russians have shown our armies are in need of modernization to combat future attacks. By using new western firearms and hiring western trained officers, we might do better in future confrontations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
establish_jiangnan_ports_title;Renovate the Jiangnan Ports;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
establish_jiangnan_ports_desc;Since the days of the Tang and Song, the Yangtze Delta has been a key node of the maritime Silk Road. However, our failure to keep up with developments in harbor technology has allowed foreign ports like Macau to take over this profitable trade. If we are to regain control of our foreign commerce, we must renovate the ports of Hangzhou and Suzhou to be able to compete with the ports of the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
use_our_jesuit_contacts_title;Use our Jesuit Contacts;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
use_our_jesuit_contacts_desc;The Jesuit Order has long been active in our country as missionaries and advisors since they were recognized by Emperor Sukjong in the late 17th century. We should consider using these foreigners to end our isolationism from the outside world by making contact with their headquarters in the far Eastern land of Colombia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
chinese_jesuit_education_title;Support Jesuit Education?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
chinese_jesuit_education_desc;Despite our long tradition of Confucian examinations, much of our empire remains illiterate which has made modernization difficult. We could use the educational expertise of our new friends in Colombia to establish missions across China to further the education of the poor. This however may alienate those in our population who remain suspicious of the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
new_korean_army_title;The New Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
new_korean_army_desc;As Russia continues to encroach the Northern borders of our homeland in Manchuria and Korea, there is a need to strengthen our armies in the region to prevent future incursions. An eccentric Korean general called Yi Seongmin is proposing a sweeping set of army reforms aimed at modernizing our army and bringing it up to par with the foreigners. Taking these reforms will greatly improve our ability to defend our empire but at the cost of angering conservatives in the army and bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
expanding_the_coal_mines_title;Expand the Shanxi Coal Mines;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
expanding_the_coal_mines_desc;Following the 1876 North China Famine and the devastation wrought by the Nian Bandits, the once prosperous province of Shanxi lies in ruins. As our empire’s demand for coal and other minerals reaches new heights with our modernization, the governor of Shanxi has suggested an ambitious redevelopment program to use foreign technology to reopen Shanxi’s greatly reduced mines. This he says will not only provide enough coal for our modernization but also help restore Shanxi to its former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
shanxi_railways_title;Establish the Datong Railway;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
shanxi_railways_desc;As Shanxi’s reconstruction continues to progress, there is an increased need for more efficient transportation to move settlers, grain and coal in and out of the mountains. The governor has suggested the development of a rail network connecting the mountains to Beijing via the passes East of the northern city of Datong. While the governor’s plan is ambitious, the new railway would speed up Shanxi’s redevelopment and would prevent a future bottleneck of supplies at the Guguan pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
china_merchants_shipping_title;Establish the China Merchants Steamship Corporation;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
china_merchants_shipping_desc;As part of our modernization process, it is imperative we regain control over our coastal trade which has become dominated by foreign steamships which have proven faster and more reliable than our junks. The governor of Zhejiang has proposed establishing our own native owned steamship corporation to compete with the foreign ships. This would allow us to not only regain control of our internal commerce, but also enable economic expansion elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
centralization_edicts_title;The Centralization Edicts;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
centralization_edicts_desc;The devastation of the 1887 floods has clearly shown the flaws in our administration. Our lack of oversight over the provinces and the antiquated Half-Half system allowed corrupt officials to ignore their duties resulting in millions of deaths along the Yellow River. We must implement a series of administrative reforms to put an end to the Half-Half system and place the provinces under more direct control to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
yongping_taxation_reforms_title;Yongping Taxation Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
yongping_taxation_reforms_desc;Since the Three Feudatories War, our empire has been undergoing a fiscal crisis as we expend enormous sums of money to repair the damage the war has inflicted on Southern China. Some officials have proposed a sweeping series of land and taxation reforms aimed at consolidating the complex set of levies into a singular annual payment and buying arable land to plant grain to feed the poor. While these reforms may put an end to the financial crisis, they are likely to prove unpopular amongst landowners and the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
yi_seongmin_coup_title;The Rise of Yi Seongmin;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
yi_seongmin_coup_desc;A Gyeongju native with ties to the old Silla nobility, the ambitious general Yi Seongmin helped Sunjo and the reactionaries overthrow the reformist emperor Yongping as his attempts to end the Half-Half system would weaken the position of his Sillan allies at court. Aligned closely with conservative Sillan nationalists who see the dominance of the Buyeo a national disgrace, he has finally decided to seize power with the help of such conservatives to bring an end to Silla's national disgrace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
seize_manchuria_title;The Yalu Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
seize_manchuria_desc;With the recent loss of Chinese control over the Western provinces, it is clear the Buyeo are too weak to protect us. At our northern frontier, spies are reporting of foreign plans to seize Manju which would cut us off from the rest of China. We must act quickly to secure the region before it is too late, even if the Buyeo are not happy at our annexation of their traditional homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
depose_the_buyeo_emperor_title;Depose the Buyeo;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
depose_the_buyeo_emperor_desc;Following our victory against the Buyeo ingrates it is clear they have lost Heavens favor and do not deserve to call themselves emperors anymore. We should do away with them and incorporate their lands into our own expanding empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
master_of_the_west_sea_title;Secure the West Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
master_of_the_west_sea_desc;The lands on the other side of the West Sea have become overrun by superstitious peasants whose rejection of Imperial rule threatens the foundations of our political system. We must put an end to these rabble-rousers before our people get any funny ideas and try to depose our monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
pacify_the_interior_title;Pacify the Interior;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
pacify_the_interior_desc;With order restored to Shandong, we should consider moving westwards along the Yellow River to secure our rule over Northern China. The manpower and rich mineral deposits of Shanxi, Shaanxi and Gansu will help fuel our expansion as we work towards solidifying our rule over China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
secure_the_han_title;Secure the Han River;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
secure_the_han_desc;Our dominion over Northern China is almost complete. The Han River flowing through Hubei is a major tributary of the Yangtze and would allow us access to the ports of Hankou, Hanyang and Wuchang. We must take control of the river for the sake of our rising empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
kor_claim_the_mandate_of_heaven_title;Claim the Mandate of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
kor_claim_the_mandate_of_heaven_desc;As hegemon of Northern China and master of Dadu, it is clear we have won the favor of Heaven and are worthy of taking the title of Emperor of all China. Long Live Emperor Yihui, founder of the Samhan Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_kdom_shu_title;Establish the Kingdom of Shu;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_kdom_shu_desc;The Sichuan Basin is a natural fortress, surrounded by mountains and able to produce enough food to outlast a siege. We should grant the region to a loyal vassal to prevent any Buyeo pretenders from taking refuge in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_kdom_chu_title;Establish the Kingdom of Chu;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_kdom_chu_desc;With our domination of the lands North of Dongting Lake, we should ensure the South shore of the lake is under a loyal vassal. Their famous military tradition will make them a useful attack dog if we need to in future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_kdom_wu_title;Establish the Kingdom of Wu;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_kdom_wu_desc;The plains of Liangjiang have served as the economic and cultural heart of China for centuries. While directly ruling the area may prove difficult, for our small population, a loyal vassal here would be a valuable asset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_wuyue_min_title;Establish Wuyue;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_wuyue_min_desc;The southeastern coast of China has long been home to piratical populations that have long proved a threat to our security. But instead of fighting them, we could grant them positions as vassals to secure our seas from Japan.  Lets see if they enjoy seeing their shores raided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_kdom_yue_title;Establish the Kingdom of Yue;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
estab_kdom_yue_desc;The distant lands of Lingnan have always been difficult to control from Dadu. Zhuang and Viet tribes dwell in and beyond the mountains while even the Chinese eat strange foods. We should put them under a vassal king rather than take control of their lands directly, lest the barbarous nature rub off on us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
regain_international_legitimacy_title;Regain International Legitimacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
regain_international_legitimacy_desc;Ever since our coup our legitimacy has been in shambles. We should send envoys overseas to gain foreign support for our regime and strengthen our claim to the lands we hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
restore_the_emperor_title;A New Emperor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
restore_the_emperor_desc;With a strong majority in court, perhaps now is the time to do away with Yongping once and for and make Sunjo Emperor. His restoration of the Half-Half system has made him popular amongst the Koreans which will ingratiate them to our regime and perhaps lend legitimacy to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
retake_jin_title;Retake Shanxi;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
retake_jin_desc;With the return of rightful Imperial rule, it is time we restore order to the unruly provinces. Shanxi is rich in coal and will allow us to consolidate our control on the left bank of the Yellow River.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
retake_shandong_title;The Shandong Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
retake_shandong_desc;The capture of Shandong by peasant militias threatens our whole imperial system of government. Now that our Western frontier is protected, we must crush them before our own peasants get any ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
southern_expedition_title;The Conquest of Liangjiang;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
southern_expedition_desc;Liangjiang has historically proved to be one of Chinas most important regions with its agricultural and cultural prosperity. An invasion will not only put this immensely powerful region under our control again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
claim_the_mandate_of_heaven_title;Restore the Mandate of Heaven;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
claim_the_mandate_of_heaven_desc;With our recapture of Liangjiang, we have proved ourselves hegemon of China. We are now worthy of reclaiming the mandate of heaven and advancing our imperial rule over all of China. Long live the Buyeo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
accept_the_han_title;Accept the Han;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
accept_the_han_desc;Our empire is largely centered around China and while our ruling class may not be native to that land, the majority of our people are. As nationalism begins to rise and the risk of a popular national revolution increases, we should embrace Han culture and identity so as to appease the majority of our population and establish ourselves as a truly Chinese Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
permaanant_regency_title;Abandon China?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
permaanant_regency_desc;As the situation in China continues to deteriorate, perhaps the time has come for our people to return north of the Great Wall and abdicate the Mandate of Heaven. With the title of Emperor of China now obsolete, the Grand Council will take on the role of ruler in lieu of the Emperor, as we decide what new course our nation should take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
take_up_tungusic_banner_title;Take up the cause of Tungusic Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
take_up_tungusic_banner_desc;While we may have adopted the language and customs of the Koreans to the South, much of our population descends from the Mohe, through which we share kinship with the Uljeokhap. As we seek to chart a new course, perhaps we should consider this aspect of our heritage and seek to unite with our distant relatives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
regain_northern_korea_title;Regain Northern Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
regain_northern_korea_desc;Some of our ancestral homelands south of the Yalu remain under Korean ownership. As their overlord, we should force them to return our lost territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
free_north_tungus_title;Free our Northern Brothers;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
free_north_tungus_desc;With the Mohe lands now under our control, we should consider the plight of our northern brothers under the Russian yoke. We should move Northwards and free the Evenks by incorporating them into our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
tunguskan_hegemony_title;Form Tunguska;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
tunguskan_hegemony_desc;With our hegemony over the lands of our cousins the time has come for us to embrace this new national identity. No longer shall Buyeo, Uljeokhap and Evenk stand as seperate nations. We shall become a united Tungusic Nation and fend off anyone who wishes to settle our lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
form_the_korean_federation_title;Establish the Korean Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
form_the_korean_federation_desc;Despite our differences, Koreans and Buyeo alike share many similarities. We share similar languages and culture and together have achieved great things. Though we may have split on many issues, the time has come for us to unite as one again, towards a more perfect union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
incorporate_buyeo_lands_title;Incorporate Buyeo Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
incorporate_buyeo_lands_desc;With the Buyeo accepted as a key part of our state, there is no doubt that we should inherit their former holdings in Manju as part of our nation. This will allow us to unite all Koreans and Buyeo under one banner once again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
EVTNAME651891;The 1876 North Chinese Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651891;Reports of famine are coming into Dadu from all across Northern China following recent droughts and crop failures. From Shanxi to Shandong, people are dying of disease and starvation in the millions while families are forced to sell wives and daughters to buy grain to survive. Whilst sending relief efforts would be crucial, doing so would take away funds we desperately need for our modernization programs. Do we send aid to the starving masses or focus on modernizing our country as a whole so such disasters can never happen again?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651892;Drawing Tears from Iron;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651892;As news of the tragedies occurring on a daily basis in the Central Plains reach the wealthy ports of Southern China, philanthropists in Suzhou have begun publishing a pamphlet of famine illustrations in an attempt to raise funds to aid the starving Northern provinces. Titled “The Incredible Famine in Henan : Pictures to draw Tears from Iron ", the piece brings the horror of the famine to Suzhou audiences through its poetic descriptions of the suffering of its victims, accompanied by illustrations showing in graphic detail the stories of cannibalism, suicide and human trafficking that have circulated around China. The work has already proven effective in drawing money from Suzhou wallets for famine relief, and copies are already being circulated around the rest of Jiangnan and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651893;The Nian Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651893;Ever since the 1876 North Chinese Famine, bands of peasant bandits have been prevalent across the Central Plains. Highly mobile due to their mounted nature, many of these so-called Nian bandits were pushed into a life of crime during the famine out of desperation for food. As the starvation subsides and regular harvests return, these angry peasants have become bolder, attacking government offices to seize valuables to sell on the black market. While their motives may be sympathetic, we cannot let the Central Plains slip into complete anarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651895;War Against the Buyeo;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651895;The heartless Buyeo government has declared war against us and our comrades, accusing us of being bandits and calling on their army to crush us with all force. We must rally our forces and use equipment requisitioned from Buyeo garrisons, drive these foreigners out of our homeland. Down with the Buyeo, and let the Nian flag rise!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651894;End of the Nian;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651894;As the Nian armies flee, scattered and broken, we have won a decisive victory. The leaders of the Nian have been sentenced  to death by lingzhi as an example to anyone else who dares commit acts of banditry against our government. With our forces once more in control of Central China, order has been restored and the common people allowed to live in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651896;Establishment of the Eastern Learning Circle;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651896;As our country continues to modernize, many in our court have begun to question whether or not such changes will bring on the wrath of Heaven. In the Buyeo court, a faction of conservatives known as the Eastern Learning Circle have been founded at the Xingsheng Palace under the leadership of the brother of the Emperor, Prince Sunjo. While their promotion of traditional Confucian governance may boost our prestige, it will also slow our development significantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651897;Anqing Tax Riots;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651897;While the new taxation reforms have been well-received in Northern China, in the Yangtze Delta opposition to the reforms is widespread. Many businessmen have become used to lax taxation policies dating back to the foundation of the Buyeo dynasty and have no interest in any changes that may raise their annual commitments. In Anqing, angry landlords have begun rioting outside the yamen demanding a return to old policies. What should we do in the face of such defiance?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651898;Feng-Shui Protection Societies;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651898;Though our new railways have greatly sped up transport across China, opposition to the new technology is growing, often led by local elders who claim that the railways destroy the natural feng shui of an area resulting in disastrous consequences. These feng-shui protection societies have already caused great damage to state-run railways and unless we find some way to appease or oppose them, it is likely our plans for a modern transport system will fail.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651899;1887 Yellow River Floods;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651899;Following a period of heavier than normal rainfall in Henan province, the Yellow River has begun to overflow the dikes on its riverbanks, inundating vast areas of farmlands in the province. Casualties number in the hundreds of thousands. While some may say this is the result of Heaven’s wrath at our reforms, the true culprit lies in the millenia of accumulated riverbed silt which continues to raise the water level higher and higher, giving our dikes little leeway in the event of a sudden increase in water level. While dredging the Yellow River and rebuilding its banks would make future disasters less likely, the cooperation between provinces needed for such a large task will require much more centralization than has been seen in China for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651900;The Spread of Western Technology;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651900;After decades of hard work, our Westernization programs have finally borne fruit. From Guizhou to Manju, modern technology has proliferated and become ubiquitous in daily life as steamships ferry rice up and down the Yangtze and along the coast while modern mines and railways bring coal from the mountains into the new factories popping up across China. While the road was not easy, we can say at last that China and the Buyeo Empire have entered the ranks of the civilized world.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651901;The Spread of Modern Military Ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651901;As our empire continues to face threats from all sides, there has been increased interest by frontier governors in the new army reforms taking place near Dadu and in our traditional heartlands of Manju and Korea. The governor of Shaan-Gan has already requested attaches from the New Armies to train his men on the frontier with Tibet while even central Liangjiang and Huguang have become training their militias in the new style. Clearly, our governors can see a good development when it is presented before them.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651903;Conflict with the Provinces;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651903;While our recent reforms to strengthen our country have proved successful, they have also alienated conservative elements of our population. Some desire to return to traditionalist Confucian governance, while others simply want to protect their local privileges and traditions. In what appears to be a planned action, the landowning and bureaucratic elites of the provinces of Silla and Lyangjang have recently issued edicts of their own, reversing some of our reforms in their own provinces. Such an act is a clear attack on our imperial authority and threatens to plunge the nation into civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651904;The Autumn of Daedo Palace;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651904;The Yongping reforms have alienated not only the provinces but also many in Dadu itself who believe his actions have brought the country to the precipice of collapse. On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, a division of the Korean Army led by Lee Seongmin marched into Dadu and with help from members of the Eastern Learning Circle took the Emperor hostage. With Yongping now a prisoner in the Buyeo Palace, a regency council led by his brother Sunjo and consisting largely of members of the Eastern Learning Circle has been established to run Buyeo. While Sunjo may celebrate his new ascendancy in court, such violent action against the established order has severely weakened Buyeo legitimacy and bodes poorly for its control over the provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651905;Rebellion on the Yangtze;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651905;Though we were only acting in the Empire’s best interests, much of the country sees our coup as nothing more than an illegitimate power grab. The governors of Huguang and Shanxi refuse to acknowledge the regency council as legitimate while in Min-Zhe the provincial governor has established their own local government in collaboration with local merchants. While we may wish to suppress the provinces, we have recently recieved word that the Sillans, led by the ambitious Yi Seongmin are arming themselves war and rumors that he intends to make himself a king. If we march south now, we run the risk of letting traitors march into Dadu;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651906;Anarchy in the South;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651906;Our ability to control the provinces has continued to slip from our fingers. Independent minded provincial leaders in the far South have begun rearming themselves. While we would like to stop them, with the risk of a counter-coup ever present in the North, we cannot afford to send troops southwards.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651907;Troubles on the Frontier;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651907;As in the South, our weakness has allowed malcontents and enemies to take open action against us. In the West, the Tibetans and even our nominal vassal, the Koshut Oirats have begun launching raids against us. With our armies preoccupied with suppressing resistance in the North, the governors of Sichuan and Shaan-Gan have been forced to arm themselves as Liangguang and Guizhou have. While we are loath to accept it, this might be the only way to secure our frontiers.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651908;Korea seizes Manju!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651908;Korean armies have recently marched into our homeland of Manju, deposing the rightful governor and declaring Yi Seongmin Emperor of China! Such treason from the Sillans must be punished at once! ;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651909;The Buyeo-Korean War;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651909;The Sillans have rejected our demands to hand over Yi Seongmin and are now marching beyond the Liao towards the walls of Dadu. Our pleas for help have been ignored by the provinces. We must face this threat head on and alone, if we are to survive the oncoming storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651910;Buyeo Victory in the Buyeo-Korean War!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651910;As Buyeo armies cross over the Yalu River, the Koreans sue for peace and have agreed to withdraw from Manju and hand over Lee Seongmin for execution. With a new governor being appointed to rule over Silla, it is clear they have eliminated the most serious threat to our regime.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651911;Korean Victory in the Buyeo-Korean War;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651911;Despite the best efforts of the Buyeo, their armies have been defeated and their empire has fallen. The Regency Council has been deposed and Yi Seongmin is Emperor in Dadu.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651916;Korean Victory in the Buyeo-Korean War!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651916;Our armies have emerged victorious in the struggle against the Regency Council and a Sillan, Yi Seongmin, sits on the imperial throne. For the first time in centuries, it is the Sillans, not the Buyeo, who hold hegemony in Northeast Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651912;The Buyeo Response;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651912;The Buyeo court has sent us an ultimatum demanding that we hand over Yi Seongmin to be tried for treason and to withdraw south of the Yalu. We must decide whether to back down now or to continue with the path we are on.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651913;Shandong Peasants Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651913;The Shandong peninsula has long been a haven for secret societies opposed to our rule. Now, we have received news that these societies, led by the heretical Donghak sect have seized power in Jinan, taking advantage of our preoccupation with the war against Korea. Gathering in the thousands at Mount Tai, China’s sacred mountain, these peasant rebels have declared their aim to establish an earthly paradise and free China’s peasants from so-called tyranny.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651888;A Divided Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651888;Ever since the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, China has been ripe for conquest and invasion. From the Mongols hordes that brought down the Song to the Tibetan, Uighur and Yi raids that left Daguang ripe for the Balhae conquest, the people of China have constantly found themselves at war with hostile and powerful invaders. Such raids have left their mark on the people of China, encouraging the rise of strong provincial leaders that could better protect the peasants against foes from all sides while draining the strength of central authority. As the world enters a new age of innovation and new threats emerge, will the people of China be able to band together against the rising storm or will the Middle Kingdom be torn apart for the wolves of a new age?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651887;The Lack of New World Crops;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651887;In the Throne of Lorraine timeline, European colonization of the Columbias (the Americas) was significantly less successful. Without a strong European presence in the Pacific Coast of the Columbias, no Trans-Pacific silver trade developed to bring New World crops to China by sea while the spread of crops by land via the Silk Road and Yunnan was limited as a weakened Chinese presence in the peripheries resulted in more instability and reduced trade. Coupled with the loss of population in the Early Modern era to wars against foreign invaders like the Tibetans or Uighurs, the Chinese population is much lower than in OTL.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651889;Southern Devastation;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651889;Our war against the Three Feudatories has resulted in significant destruction across South China. Towns from Fujian to Sichuan lay burned while refugees roam the countryside, occasionally robbing passers-by to obtain money for food. As the costs of rebuilding  mount, it is clear our government is heading towards a full budgetary crisis. While the conflict may has ended, its scars will continue to show for some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651890;The Hakka Punti Clan War;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651890;Of the provinces left devastated by the Three Feudatories War, Guangdong was amongst the worst affected, having suffered the depredations of both the Guangseo and Buyeo armies. In the impoverished landscape of flooded riverbanks and looted villages, long simmering tensions between the native Yue and immigrant Hakka populations came roaring back to life as competition for resources intensified. In the Taishan area west of Canton, the Siap Yue have begun attacking Hakka villages and the Hakka are beginning to respond in kind. We can choose to send armies to intervene and seperate the parties before too much blood is spilt, or do nothing at the cost if increased casualties. What shall we do? ;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651902;The Reorganization of Southern China;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651902;As part of our reconstruction of Southern China, it is imperative that we must reintegrate the feudatory lands in a manner so that they can never threaten our rule over China. Fujian will be merged into Zhejiang while Yun-Gui and Guangseo will be incorporated into the new provinces of Guizhou and Liangguang and placed under more direct control. Hopefully these measures will be enough to prevent future rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;
