EVTNAME651935;Rule of the Padri;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651935;Ever since the fall of the Pagaruyung Empire to the Padri in 1815, Central Sumatra has been suffering under the rule of Islamic fundementalists. The traditional adat has been abolished ending centuries of matrilineal inheritence and men are forced to dress in Arabic dress. Meanwhile, the Padri clerics live like kings, treating the people as their slaves and murdering all who oppose them, even their own teachers. While the people cry out for someone to deliver them from the Padri, few seem ready to put their lives on the line to do so and the heirs of Adityawarman have fled to safety in Johor. However, with the clerics unpopularity continuing to rise, any sign of weakness is likely to be catastrophic for the Padri. Any chink in their armour, even a single defeat against another state, could bring about their downfall.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651920;Fall of the Padri;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651920;With our recent defeat, the Padri have lost the ability to enforce their brutal form of Islam on the people. The heirs of Adityawarman have returned from their exile in Negeri Sembilan to take back their old empire once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651921;The Chinese Diaspora;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651921;The devastation of the last decade has driven many young men off their lands in search of a new life. While some are heading for newly opened borderlands of Dongbei and Xinjiang, a large proportion, especially in Southern China, are leaving China altogether in search of a new life. Thousands of migrants depart from Xiamen and Chaozhou, destined for the tin mines and pepper plantations of the Malay Archipelago. While Chinese migration to Southeast Asia is not new, the sheer scale of this new migration will surely leave a demographic mark on the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651922;The Arrival of Chinese Migrants;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651922;Following the recent wars in China, large numbers of Chinese men have begun leaving their country in search for a new life in Southeast Asia. The rich mines and plantations in our country have proven extremely attractive to these soujourners who seek to make their fortune in the resource extraction business. While some in our country are suspicous of the new arrivals, many of whom insist staying distinct from our own people, they are already contributing greatly to our society. While some may say they are only sojourners and should leave as soon as possible, it appears they are here to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651923;Exile Padri clerics to Australia?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651923;Ever since their victory in Sumatra, the Padri have been sending Islamic clerics across the archipelago. Some of these clerics have recently made their way to our shores and are corrupting our population with radical ideas. One of our advisors has proposed exiling these clerics and their followers to Marege which has recently returned to our ownership. Doing so will likely result in the loss of Marege but will allow us to remove these malcontents from our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651924;The Coronation of Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651924;In recent years, our state has been gaining more autonomy as the declining Johor empire proves unable to assert its will on its vassals. While the previous Bendahara Muhammad was unwilling to act openly against the Sultan of Johor, his son Mahmud Muzzafar Shah had no such qualms and openly talked of overhtrowing Johor rule and reestablishing Pahang as its own kingdom. With Bendahara Muhammad now dead and Mahmud Muzaffar Shah now Bendahara, perhaps now is the time for Pahang to overthrow its oppressors and take its place as an independent state once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651925;Back Bendahara Ali?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651925;News has reached Bintan that the new Bendahara, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah, has declared himself Sultan and rejects our authority openly. A rival claimant to the Pahang throne, Ali, has recently approached us requesting for help to depose his treasonous cousin and reclaim Pahang for the sons of the deposed Bendahara Hussein. While doing so will put us in open conflict with Pahang, letting their rebellion go unpunished will only invite more rebellion elsewhere in our empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651926;Victory of Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651926;With the armies of Johor crushed in the field, we have succesfully driven the Sumatran pretenders out of the Malay peninsula. With the Sumatrans driven out of the peninsula, the nobility of Johor and Negeri Sembilan have begun waving Pahang banners as they welcome Sultan Mahmud Muzzafar Shah as their new overlord. While their loyalty remains questionable, with some holding more alleigence to the crushed Sultan, it is clear they respect our strength more than that of Bintan. After more than a hundred years of Sumatran rule, Malaya is once more in Malayan hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651927;Rebellions in our Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651927;With the recent independence of Pahang, our other vassals in Aceh and Kedah have declared their independence from what they see as a dead and dying empire. We must act quickly to suppress their rebellions, or our empire will truly be consigned to the dustbin of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651928;Victory for the Sultan of Johor;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651928;Despite his best efforts, the armies of the so-called Sultan of Pahang proved unable to stand up to our armies and a loyal Bendahara has been placed in Kuantan. With Pahang now securely under our watch, it is clear to all our vassals that our empire is not merely a fangless tiger and that rebellion will be punished as is deemed fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651929;The Retirement of William Farquhar;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651929;For the past twenty-three years, William Farquhar has served as Governor-General of the Scottish East Indies, guiding in its wars against the Mataram Sultanate and expanding its influence to Bengkulu, Palembang and Bali. A natural diplomat, this son of Aberdeen proved adept at cultivating friendships with the Rajas, Sultans and assorted Chiefs of the region and his departure was met with much sadness. As he boarded the ship to take him back to Glasgow, the Chinese community of Caledonia presented him with a silver cup in gratitude for his service, a sentimenty shared by many in the region. While some may say his actions only furthered European expansion in the region, he will remain sorely missed.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651930;Return Singapore and Melaka?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651930;Ever since the defeat of the Venetians in the 1784 Ethiopian-Venetian War, the port cities of Melaka and Singapura have remained under our protection, on behalf of the weakened Johor Sultanate. Recently however, the Malays have asked for these cities to be returned to them as they believe themselves strong enough to hold them against any future Venetian aggression. While doing so will weaken our position in the Indies, not doing so will be seen as a violation of our agreement by the Malays and will harm relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651931;Ethiopia accepts our request;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651931;The Ethiopians have accepted our demands and returned Melaka and Singapura to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651932;The Ethiopians reject the return of the cities;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651932;Despite it being against the spirit of the agreement, the Ethiopians have refused all offers to return Singapura and Melaka to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651933;The Fall of Caledonia;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651933;The natives of the Indies have overrun our factories in the Indies and with the lives of our citizens at stake, we must give in to their demands and we and our vassals must return any territories they claim as theirs. The world will not let us forget this humiliation easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651934;Independence from Caledonia;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651934;The fall of Caledonia has broken the back of European power in the region. With the Europeans unable to enforce their demands on us any longer, we will no longer need pay homage to them and can pursue our own path once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651936;Rebellion in the Indies!;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651936;Fighting has broken out across Indonesia as Indonesian revolutionary nationalists backed by $FROMCOUNTRY$ have seized power in Caledonia and other cities. These so-called Indonesian nationalists are demanding that we withdraw from the Indies at once and hand over all of our colonies so they can establish an Indonesian state. Do we surrender to their demands or will we fight to the bitter end to protect our holdings?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651937;Indonesian victory in the Indonesian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651937;Despite the best attempts of the Europeans to put us down, the Indonesian people have proven themselves to bold and brave to simply be corralled back into slavery. With the recent European withdrawal from Indonesia, it is clear the Indonesian people have won their freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651938;End of the Indonesian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651938;Despite the best efforts of the Indonesians, their attempts to overthrow European colonial rule have come to naught. The ringleaders of the war have been arrested and hanged and any native states that dared aid the uprising have been placed under closer European administration. While the Indonesians thought revolution would free them from their shackles, it has only tightened the noose around their neck.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651939;The Surabaya Massacres;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651939;As we expand our colonial grip over the archipelago, unfortunate incidents are sadly becoming more commonplace. In Surabaya last week, a dispute between local Makassarese and customs officials over new duties on imported sea cucumbers ended in violence as the panicky colonial militia ended up firing into a crowd of angry Makassarese merchants demanding to know new duties were imposed without their consent. This incident only inspired more violence and by the end of what would be known as the Five Days of Surabaya much of the city lay in ruins as fighting between Surabaya locals and colonial militia left the city a husk of its former self. Casualties are unknown, but some estimate thousands of Surabaya residents dead and many more missing. Many blame the the high death-toll on the heavy handed colonial response and radical groups are begining to call for our removal from the Indies.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651940;Support Indonesian Nationalists?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651940;The massacres of peaceful protestors in Surabaya marked the begining of an Indonesian national awakening across the archipelago as writers and young radicals of all sorts called for an end to European rule and atrocities in the archipelago. Our people share kinship with the victims of European colonisation and while we have been spared from direct European rule, we can still feel the pressures of their prescence around us. Recently, some young revolutionary exiles have entered our country, seeking assylum from the authorities in Caledonia where they are wanted for subversive acts against their colonial masters. While sheltering them may gain the ire of the Europeans, our own people are likely to respond negatively if we leave them to the mercy of the Europeans. Shall we join our enslaved brothers and sisters in their struggle for freedom, or let them rot in slavery?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651942;The Fall of Caledonia;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651942;The natives of the Indies have overrun our factories in the Indies and with the lives of our citizens at stake, we must give in to their demands and we and our vassals must return any territories they claim as theirs. The world will not let us forget this humiliation easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME651941;End of the Indonesian War of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC651941;Despite our best efforts, our attempts to overthrow European colonial rule have come to naught.;;;;;;;;;;;;
kangchu_system_title;The Kangchu System;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
kangchu_system_desc;The southern states of the Malay peninsula have long remained largely uninhabited forests only inhabited by tigers and other wild creatures. There however, has been a recent influx of Chinese merchants into this region seeking to find land for cash crops. Ibrahim, a cousin of the Temenggong, has proposed granting these merchants titles and permits to establish riverside plantations in Southern Malaya. This will promote the immigration of loyal Chinese to the area and help us develop this distant frontier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
jews_of_the_east_title;The Jews of the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
jews_of_the_east_desc;For generations, our people have made their way across the South Sea and inhabited the lands of Nanyang, living under the protection of the native kings. However, as foreign imperialists continue to encroach on these lands, enslaving our kin in plantations and mines, it is clear we cannot rely on others to protect us. The lands of Nanyang must come under our direct control, for the sake of our brethren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
south_china_unity_title;South China Unityz;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
south_china_unity_desc;Even as we seek to expand our reach overseas, we should consider those close to us at home. While we may have our differences, we share great similarities with our fellow coastal Nanfaren. As the inland northerners burn China to the ground, we must protect our cultural kin from the turmoil and together seek our destiny overseas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
incorporate_nanyang_title;Greater Nanyang;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
incorporate_nanyang_desc;In the process of protecting our overseas kin, we have acquired numerous other possesions that are now primarily populated by Chinese. While our history in these areas may not be long, we should nevertheless incorporate these areas into Nanyang as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
unite_nanyang_title;Qianwang Nanyang;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
unite_nanyang_desc;It is clear our destiny lies not with Dadu and the chaos of the Central Plains but with our relatives who have emigrated to the southern seas. With Nanyang now firmly under our control, we should embrace our southern virtues and establish our own state seperate from northern China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
found_hong_leong_title;Found Kwong Lee Mortgage and Remittance Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
found_hong_leong_desc;As the immigration of Chinese labour to Southeast Asia intensifies, there is an increased demand for institutions to process remittance payments and mortgages for coolies and businessmen. In 1905, Kwong Lee Mortgage and Remittance Company was established in 1905 in Kuching to provide such services and its conservative policies and strong cash reserves allowed it to remain competitive in spite of many economic crises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,

chamber_of_commerce_desc;As Chinese businessmen continue to expand their holdings in Nanyang, there has been increased interest in establishing a common institution to defend their business interests in the region. We should establish a united Chinese Chamber of Commerce to regulate and defend Chinese business interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,

form_malayan_empire_title;Unite Malaya;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
form_malayan_empire_desc;For centuries, the Malay nation has been under attack from outside forces, from Java, Siam and now Europe. With our hegemony over the straits of Melaka assured, we should unite the Malays of the region under one banner to better resist foreign rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
malays_never_die_title;Takkan Melayu hilang di dunia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
malays_never_die_desc;While the core Malay territory in the straits of Melaka may be under our control, there are many other Malays that remain outside our territory. To ensure the survival of the Malay nation, we must bring them under our leadership as well to better resist foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
malayu_raya_title;Majulah Malaysia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
malayu_raya_desc;Ever since the days of the Melaka Sultanate, Malay has served as the lingua franca of the archipelago from Sumatra to the Moluccas. With the Malays united at last under one banner, we should turn this linguistic hegemony into a political one. Onwards Malaysia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;,

heirs_to_the_majapahit_desc;With the Europeans evicted from Caledonia and Central Java, Sunda, Madura and Bali under our control, Java has reached a level of unity not seen since the days of the mighty Majapahit Empire. We should take advantage of our ascendency and make an empire of our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,

malayan_rubber_boom_title;The Malayan Rubber Boom;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
malayan_rubber_boom_desc;As the global demand for rubber reaches new heights, we should consider planting plantations to take advantage of the boom in rubber prices. With Malaya's environment being perfect for rubber plantations, such a focus is likely to result in a rapid increase in revenue as well as immigrants seeking work in the plantations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
royal_selangor_pewter_title;Royal Selangor Pewter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
royal_selangor_pewter_desc;The tin mines of Western Malaya are proving incredibly profitable and various companies have emerged around the Klang River processing the raw material into finished pewter products. One such well known manafacturer named Selangor Pewter has recently requested for a royal endorsement for their company. Such a boon would greatly encourage the tin industry in the region and the resulting economic boom would likely prove beneficial for our finances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
daeng_ibrahim_title;Appoint Ibrahim as Bendahara;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
daeng_ibrahim_desc;With our victory over the Sumatrans in the recent civil war complete, we should redistribute titles to those who remained loyal to us in the conflict. Once such loyalist was Ibrahim, a distant cousin of Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah. We should appoint him Bendahara and entrust him with the redevelopment of Pahang for the benefit of our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
capital_muar_title;Relocate to Johor;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
capital_muar_desc;The recent conflict in Pahang has shown that the Malayans in our empire cannot be left unsupervised lest they revolt in our absence. With Pahang now secure, we should relocate our capital from Bintan to the Johor mainland to allow us to keep a better eye on the Malayans in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
regain_straits_ports_title;Request the return of Melaka and Singapura;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
regain_straits_ports_desc;In 1784, a combined Ethiopian-Johor army was able to retake our ancient cities of Singapura and Melaka from the Venetians but with our armies exhausted from wars with Siam, left the garrison of the cities to the Ethiopian merchants. With our military now in better shape, it is time for us to request the return of the two cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,

abu_bakar_desc;Following the death of Ibrahim in 1861, his son Abu Bakar is prime to inherit the Bendaharaship of Pahang in 1862. A Caledonophile, he plans to revamp industry and transport in Pahang with the help of Scottish engineers, with plans to build railways linking our hulu and hillir holdings and for new mills to process our raw wood into lumber for export to China and India.;;;;;;;;;;;;;,
