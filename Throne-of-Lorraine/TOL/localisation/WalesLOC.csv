welsh_cornwall_title;Legitimize Our Ownership of Cernyw;;;;;;;;;;;;;
welsh_cornwall_desc;We have achieved what we set to do and liberated Cernyw while simultaneously dooming the absolutist Westminster Loyalists. Whether we will be able to maintain our newly gained territory against the Parliamentary English remains to be seen. In the meantime, we can attempt to legitimize our victory by gaining international recognition through the renaming of English cities to their Welsh translations and allowing our Cornish cousins to use their native Celtic brother language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cornish_equality_title;Full Citizenship for the Cornish People;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cornish_equality_desc;Even though our Celtic brothers, the Cornish, have a lot in common with us, extending completely equal rights to any unique cultural or ethnic group is no simple task. After a few years of legislation and negotiation, we are now ready to grant full citizenship to our Cornish brethren, from voting rights to parliamentarian representation. This will mark a stark contrast from the oppression they faced under the Westminster regime, and indifference-at-best from the previous parliamentarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

invest_in_trevithick_desc;With the recent passing of historically influential Cornish mechanical and civil engineer Richard Trevithick, ownership of his massive boiler manufactory has officially to his eldest sons. Several in the government have proposed ways to honor his legacy and the impact he had on the Industrial Revolution. His sons meanwhile have petitioned the government for grants and investments to fund the continuation of research and development of their father's pre-mortem projects. They are indeed requesting a significant amount of money, but they have therefore offered a return on investment in the form of several favorable contracts for the navy's growing fleet of modern steam warships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
establish_coaling_port_title;Make An Offer For An Atlantic Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;
establish_coaling_port_desc;As cross-Atlantic trade continues to grow alongside the use of steam powered ships, the demand for coal is skyrocketing accordingly. Alongside all the advantages which are inherent in steam engine powered ships over sailing ships, one disadvantage is the need for sufficient fuel. This is especially troublesome on voyages where there are few to no refueling points. As one of the world's leading suppliers of coal, we should seek to capitalize on this by establishing a highly-demanded coaling port for Atlantic voyages. The only obstacle is how to acquire a suitably located island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They sought to capitalize on the lucrative English Channel commerce, but towards the end of their occupation their success waned. With some state investments, we could expand the existing infrastructure and cash in on this market ourselves. Turning these backwater isles into a wealthy tradehub would be just as beneficial to us as the Genoans wished it to be for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME959501;State of War Renders Treaty of Bristol Null and Void;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC959501;Despite our previously successful negotiations with the Welsh regarding the territory of Cornwall and the economic treaty struck from same, the international diplomatic situation at large has set our nations at odds regardless. Needless to say, Wales will not be honoring their side of the deal while our men kill eachother on the field of battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

At the age of 69, Richard Trevithick has succumbed to the effects of an extended battle with illness and the ailments of old age. He leaves his manufactories to his eldest sons, who have vowed to live up to their influential father and continue his research and development of high pressure steam engines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME9111;Welsh Offer to Buy Isles of Scilly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9111;In the midst of our current turmoil, yet another diplomatic envoy has sent us a communique. Thankfully they are not declaring yet another state of war against us- yet. Wales, our old trade competitor from the north, has demanded we transfer the Isles of Scilly to their sovereignty. Given our current empire wide secession crisis, this seems a blatant attempt to take advantage of us, as they have only offered a paltry sum in exchange. Still, we must ask ourselves, would it be wise to make yet another enemy?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA9111;We need the money to fund campaigns closer to home;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB9111;We will not bow before those opportunistic scoundrels!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME9112;The Genoans Accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9112;The Genoans have seen reason and accepted our offer. Though we are a bit less wealthy, what we lose in funds we more than make up for by reuniting our people back into their mouther country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA9112;Llongyfarchiadau!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME9113;The War Torn Genoans Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9113;Despite our generous offer and indisputable claim to the islands, the Genoans refused to return Scilly to us, even amidst their current national crisis. If we back down, we will look like a paper dragon. We have no choice but to press our claim and liberate our brethren by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA9113;I Ryfel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME9114;Restore the Welsh Frontier to Offa's Dyke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9114;Over one thousand years ago, the Mercian king Offa oversaw the construction of a monumental earthwork which still stands to this day. The exact purpose of this barricade is debated among historians, but one purpose it had served for centuries was to delineate the border between England and Wales, both culturally and diplomatically. In the early 1400's, Owen Glendower tried to overthrow this status quo with his treacherous revolt againt the crown, establishing Welsh independence and subsequently pushing the Welsh frontier further inward to the rivers Severn and Mersey. Over four hundred years later we have finally wrought justice upon the treasonous scoundrels of Wales, and now we can restore Herefordshire and Shropshire to their rightful Anglo-Saxon roots.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA9114;Take What is Ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME9116;The Fate of Cornwall;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9116;Although we have won a glorious victory against the Westminster Absolutists and restored the governance of Parliament to across the southern counties, our victory is not complete. Amidst the nationwide turmoil, the opportunistic Welsh have snuck in and stolen Cornwall from our weaker former foes. They've already tried to justify this to us by bringing up the presence of their Brittonic brethren the Cornish and the assistance they indirectly lent to us during the Civil War. They've offered us plenty of concessions to convince us not to demand the south west peninsula be returned to us, and while these may seem hardly a fair trade for leaving the reconquest of England proper unfinished, we may not be in a position to declare a new war against a fresh enemy. It may be better to use their proposed economic and diplomatic agreements to buy time and prepare for a future liberation of our rightful lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA9116;What War Exhaustion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB9116;They will loan us the money with which we will fund our rearmament. In five years, we will revisit this issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME9117;The Anglo-Welsh Trade Agreement Is Up For Renewal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9117;The agreed upon five year duration of the Anglo-Welsh Trade Agreement has elapsed and the treaty is up for renegotions and renewal. This gives us two options: We could negotiate in good faith and extend the deal, or we could use this as a caus belli for the liberation of our lost counties. If we send them terms they would have to refuse, we can blame the break down in communication on them and declare war over this humilation. The only remaining question is whether we've given ourselves enough time to prepare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA9117;We've waited long enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB9117;That Welsh Econussy Got Me Actin Unwise;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME9118;Opening of the Padarn Railway;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9118;Gwynedd is known for its slate mines, and Dinorwic Quarry is one of the largest. With the abundance of sturdy slate seeping out of the mountains of Wales, the main hurdle has been transportation. Construction was completed today on the Padarn Railway, a 7 mile long, 4 foot narrow gauge rail line from the quarry to Port Dinorwic and one of the first in our nation to take advantage of steam powered traction. Increased haulage provided by the railway will facilitate increased production by the quarry and higher export revenue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA9118;Full Steam Ahead;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME9119;Talyllyn & Ffestiniog Railways Begin Use of Steam Locomotives;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC9119;In recent years, slate mine production has shattered records, and this is due in large part to the industrial revolution. Perhaps most important to this process has been the steam engine, both in its stationary and mobile forms. Although stationary steam engines have pumped water out of mines and hauled waggons up steep inclines for decades now, their locomotive cousins have now been refined to a point of relative efficiency and reliability to be widely employable across Wales’ network of narrow gauge tramways. Not only do these miniature railways facilitate the mass transport of slate for export, but the narrow gauges also allow for the transit of passengers to even the most remote of mountainous farms, mills and homesteads. It’s becoming easier than ever for the people of North Wales to spread out from the coast and civilize the undulating interior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA9119;All Aboard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME59001;Weighing Our Options;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC59001;After reviewing the islands which could be suitable for the task at hand, parliament has settled on Teutonoburg and Bermuda as the two best options to choose from. Teutonoburg, which the Teutons originally used as a staging area for their religious incursions aimed at countering the heretical Jesuit influence over the South Colombian native tribes, would be an ideal location for merchant ships sailing to and from African trade routes. Bermuda on the other hand is perfectly positioned to refuel commerce vessels exchanging raw materials from the new world for finished goods from the old world. The only questions are, who is more likely to agree to the deal, and which route do we figure is more important to the global economy?.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA59001;Teutonoburg is the better choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB59001;Bermuda's location can't be beat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME59002;Wales Offers to Buy Teutonoburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC59002;The Welsh have come to us with an offer to purchase Teutonoburg. It is a sizeable sum, and they have promised massive investments into the port we've built which would benefit all shipping in the region. Is this a fair deal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA59002;Can't argue with that offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB59002;If this island is so important to them, then surely it's worth more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME59004;The Teutonic Knights Want More;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC59004;The Teutons have replied to our offer with a counteroffer of their own! They want to raise the price to 50,000 livre before they hand over the island. We didn't prepare for this, seeing as our original offer was supposed to be a highball to begin with. How should we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA59004;Well, it will be worth it in the long term.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB59004;It's simply not worth that much money. Forget it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC59004;How dare they make demands of us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME59005;The Teutons Have Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC59005;We have successfully negotiated a deal with the Teutonic Knights to transfer ownership of Teutonoburg. We can now begin surveying the coast and drawing plans for a coaling port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA59005;Good News;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME59003;Wales Offers to Buy Bermuda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC59003;The Welsh have come to us with an offer to purchase Bermuda. It is a sizeable sum, and they have promised massive investments into the port we've built which would benefit all shipping in the region. We originally colonized Bermuda with the intention of using it as a stopping point on the way to Columbian colonies which never materialized. Since then we've held onto it to prevent our rivals from getting their hands on it, but our power to maintin our far reaching empire is crumbling rapidly. Is this a fair deal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA59003;Can't argue with that offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB59003;If this island is so important to them, then surely it's worth more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME59006;Navarre Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC59006;We have successfully negotiated a deal with the Basque government to transfer ownership of Bermuda. We can now begin surveying the coast and drawing plans for a coaling port.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTOPTA59008;A Worthwhile Investment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME59009;South Wales Mineral Railway;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC59009;With the success of our Atlantic coaling station, the demand for Welsh coal has grown exponentially. The output of south Wales coal mines has struggled to meet this demand. To remedy this, the Ministry of Transportation has amalgamated several tramways in Caerdydd county into functional, standardized modern railways for hauling large shipments of coal from the mines to the harbor. This combined with the advancements in mining technology will allow us to ship out vast quantities of coal both abroad and to our refueling station, keeping all of our customers happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
