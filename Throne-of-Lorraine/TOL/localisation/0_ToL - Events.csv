EVTDESC712340;With our rise to glory and our succesfull campaign in north Africa we should now go either east or west;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru1.t;A Last Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru1.d;The holy land languishes under the Turkish Yoke. Fellow Christians from Beirut to Jaffa are under the Sultans Jackboot. But no more! With Europe stronger than ever, now is our opportunity to set the score with the Turk once and for all! We shall demand the Sultan to surrender all territories of the Holy land immediately, and if not, we shall call for the last crusade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru2.t;A Last Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru2.d;An emissary from the pope has come, demanding all territories along the Levantine coast be surrendered immediately. If we do not acquiesce, they threaten to call a crusade. Is this a legitimate threat?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru3.t;The Turks agree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru3.d;Unbelievable news! The Sultan has agreed! This is a glorious day for all Christians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru4.t;Call for the Last Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru4.d;The Turks have, as expected, laughed away our demands. But we could be the last ones laughing. Do we call for the crusade, your holiness, or shall we call this mistake away?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru5.t;A Last Crusade?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru5.d;Strange news comes from Rome: The Pope has called for a new crusade! While this may be just more rambling from an institution on the death knell, humiliating the Turks is an appetizing goal. But is prestige worth that much to send our men overseas?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru6.t;European invasion of the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru6.d;The Europeans are beating back the Turks! While stabbing fellow Muslims may be a dishonest move, the seizure of the Holy cities is a prize we cannot pass!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru7.t;Wonderful news from Rome: ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru7.d;A Last Crusade! The Pope has called for a new crusade! Finally, our mission is within grasp again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru8.t;Defeat in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru8.d;Disaster! With weak support from fellow Christians, The Ottomans rallying their nation with a call for Jihad, and military failures, we have been beaten from the Holy land again. Now, where do we go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru10.t;Defeat in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru10.d;Disaster! With weak support from the Empire, The Pope rallying fellow Europeans, and military failures, we have been beaten from the Holy land. Now, where do we go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru11.t;Victory in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru11.d;Praise God! We have seized Jerusalem! As Papal soldiers march into Jerusalem, fellow Christians rejoice in happiness!  This is a glorious day for all Christians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru12.t;Victory in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru12.d;Praise God! We have beaten back the Crusaders! The prestige of the Empire has been strengthened, and the Sultan is more respected than ever!  This is a glorious day for all Muslims!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru13.t;Victory in the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cru13.d;Praise God! We have seized Jerusalem! The prestige of the Papal state has been strengthened, and the Pope is more popular than ever!  This is a glorious day for all Christians!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU1.T;Guangseo seizes Guangdong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU1.D;Upon the death of our governor-general for Guangdong, Pak Yeong-hyeon, our dysfunctional court has been struggling to decide on a candidate for the next governor-general. Seizing this opportunity, It seems that the king of Guangseo has appointed his choice for governor, under the pretext of giving his advice. Though infuriating that our subordinate would just nominate a loyalist to him, his choice seems to be popular with the people. The court has bickered the opportunity for intervention away.;;;;;;;;;;;; ;
FEU2.T;Guangseo is now under our control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU2.D;Upon the death of the governor-general for Guangdong, Pak Yeong-hyeon, we have managed to secure our candidate for the new governor-general! As according to the secret deal, he is now under our control and will tie Guangdong to Guangseo even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU3.T;Bokgun Seizes Gangseo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU3.D;The maritime province of Bokgun has traditionaly produced great merchant families, and the king of Bokgun has used them to his benefit. Today, it is revealed that their influence stretches further than expected. The governor-general of Gangseo has appointed new ministers for the province without even informing us, apparently under the advice of the merchant clique. It seems that yet another province has escaped our control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU4.T;Gangseo buckles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU4.D;The governor-general of Gangseo has appointed all of our demands!This is a glorious day, and our influence grows even further!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU5.T;Un-Gui seizes Seongdo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU5.D;The unthinkable has happened. Troops from Un-Gui have just seized the capital Seongdo of Sichuan from us! Our administration seems to have fled without even a fight, and it seems like the peasants are joining the rebels. This is the most brazen attack on our authority in decades, and we need something to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU6.T;Guizhou has been captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU6.D;Our troops have seized Guiyang. The plan went better than expected, and the local farmers are greeting us as liberators. However, this move will have consequences. Consequences that we have been preparing for years. Now we strike, for the liberation of China!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU7.T;War with the Feudatories!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU7.D;"The Feudatories have been growing since their establishment, and it seems that they think they can finally strike against the Tiger. And we will teach them a lesson that they shall never forget. Those three ""kings"" shall be hanged in a few weeks!";;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU8.T;Our claims on Xikang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU8.D;The Buyeo empire crumbles in the east. This is a great opportunity to assert our claims on Xikang, and finally unite all Tibetans under our rightful rule! We must be quick and assert our control on the entire region; Then, the weak Buyeo would realize that dislodging us from Xikang would be more trouble than leaving us. Onwards to Kham!;;;;;;;;;;;; 
FEU9.T;Our claims on Dehong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU9.D;The Buyeo empire crumbles in the east, and our loyal Kachin subjects have petitioned us to unite their people and take Dehong for ourselves! As benevolent rulers, we must of course answer their call. The rich Jade from the nearby regions is, of course, a welcome addition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU10.T;The second Vietnamese Rebellion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU10.D;Disaster! As soon as our troops have left for the northern frontlines, Vietnamese separatist rebels are attacking our garrison left and right! This is a grave danger to our kingdom, and actions need to be taken immediately. Or else, we could lose it all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU11.T;All contacts to Formosa have been lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU11.D;Grave news from Formosa: The tribal aborigines have sacked the provincial capital of Kaohsiung City. Our administration has been decapitated, and our merchants have hurridly escaped to the mainland. We need to restore order immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU12.T;The pacification of the south;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU12.D;The three rebelling Feudatories have been reconqueared, and their kings have been executed. The Chinese now fear us once more, and their rebellious spirit has been beaten down. All rumours of the empire declining have been silenced, and the future looks brighter than ever. A truly glorious day for the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU13.T;Victories from the frontlines;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU13.D;As the empire's dogs flee north, we have secured all lands south of the Yangtse. Their emissaries carry the news of surrender, and we will force our demands upon them. Now, our reign is secure, free from the heedings of the false Emperor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU14.T;Final victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU14.D;Today, the guns are silent. The empire retreats north of the Yangtse, and a prominent commander has been agreed upon to administer the lands of Chu as a buffer state between the free kingdoms. This is a glorious day for the Chinese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU15.T;An Unbelievable defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FEU15.D;What went wrong? How could have this happened? We have completely lost to our formal vassals, and all lands south of the Yangtse has been lost. Can we rule over our uppity subjects any longer? Can we even claim the title of the Emperor of China? We need answers now, and we need them quick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSKAZ1.T;A raid on Akmolinsk;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSKAZ1.D;All reports from the Akmolinsk krai indicate the Kazakhs have launched a raid against our colonists. Buildings have been damaged, and the empire's prestige is tarnished. We shall ride to Kazakhstan to subdue the rowdy hordes once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSKAZ2.T;The porous border with Bukkhara;;;;;;;;;;;;;
RUSKAZ2.D;After the annexation of the Juz, we thought our troubles with the hordes were over. It wasn't. Gangs, smugglers, and criminals cross over the porous border with Bukkhara, and our citizens are suffering. We will march to Bishkek and let the Khan learn the lesson for such crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Opiumwars0.T;The Investigation of Western Ships;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Opiumwars0.D;While our quest to install our rule in Taiwan continues, one significant issue has slipped outside of our control. Our officials investigating the western merchants whom have supplied the Taiwanese with armaments apparently have gone quite overboard, and have killed Venetian sailors in a Scottish vessel. Both states are now demanding apologies-but do we follow their requests?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Opiumwars1.T;An incident in Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Opiumwars1.D;After their pacification of Taiwan, the Buyeo have been more and more brazen in regulating our ships-and one incident has crossed the line. Apparently, Buyeo officials have killed Venetian sailors in a Scottish Opium merchants vessel suspected of supplying weapons! Our population wants revenge, and our navy can deliver. But are we down to the level where we go to war for an opium merchants loss?;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME51390;Start a civil war;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC51390;The English lands are divided between two nations and there can only be on nation ruling all the English lands we shall unite it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT51390OPTA;Start the English Civil War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33409;Scotland is giving us supplies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33409;Scotland is giving us supplies while we're short on them due to this civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT33409OPTA;Nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME23908;The Aztecs wants to be friends with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC23908;We do share a common enemy, the Genoense but do we trust them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT23908OPTA;Yes, we shall be allies with the Aztecs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT23908OPTB;We should just stay on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bergenpurchase.t;The Sale of Bergen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bergenpurchase.d;A pericular offer has reached us from the Kalmar custom union. The demand is the port of Bergen, and the offer is 50,000 livres. While this is certainly a steep price for such a port, we must also consider the geopolitical consequences. Do we accept the offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NHreturns.t;Return of Nieuw Hague;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NHreturns.d;Located on the mouth of the Mississippi River, the port of Nieuw Hague is one of the most strategic cities in North America. Since its loss to the Freilanders, our economy has been limited and our maritime industry has collapsed. Now that we have recovered the city, our glory can begin anew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood0.t;Demands from the metropolitan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood0.d;We have traditionaly tried to convert our Ruthenians to the one true Catholic faith. No more, it seems. A letter from the Metropolitan of Kiev demands that freedom for his flock be allowed, or else. While the demands are harsh, if Russia intervenes with this, it could get worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood1.t;Metropolitan of Kiev requests military aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood1.d;The Metropolitan of Kiev has sent us requests of military aid, offering us the loyalty of the Ruthenians if we can free them from the Lithuanians. How can we refuse such offers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood2.t;Triumph over the Lithuanians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood2.d;With our troops marching into Lithuania, the Grand duke has sent us offers of peace. Now, we can assert our dominion over the Ruthenians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood3.t;The Loss of the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood3.d;The unthinkable has happened. Most of Ruthenia has been lost, and our troops are decimated. We may have only one option left: the Polish. But are we that desparate?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood4.t;Offers from the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood4.d;After their defeat from the Ruthenian rebels, the Lithuanians have come to us for protection. They suggest a union between us two, and promise loyalty and prosperity. A hundred wars couldn't have acheived today's offers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood5.t;Victory over Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood5.d;Victory! The Tsar's armies have been defeated, and now we own Kiev once more. The metropolitan has been exiled, and a new loyal one has been elected. Now, peace may finaly be achieved again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood6.t;Defeat in the Dneiper;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood6.d;The Dneiper runs red with Russian blood. Our foolish attempts over the Ruthenians have devastated our armies. Can we recover from this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood8.t;Loss of connection to South Ruthenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood8.d;As Russia marches east, our hold of Ruthenia weakens day by day. And today, we may have completely lost it. As Russia has cleaved our nation in half, the Southern Ruthenian portion of our lands have declared independence! As we have lost all means to deal with the rebellion, it seems that our only option is to watch. How much longer can we even remain as an independent nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood9.t;Lithuania proper lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood9.d;All lands that we have considered to be propper Lithuanian have been wrested from our control. The vast majority of our people now are Ruthenyans. This cannot continue. It is time we initiate some radical reforms to our nation, or else we wouldn't survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood10.t;Lithuanian Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Flood10.d;Ever since the loss of Lithuania proper, Lithuania was in constant political turmoil. The vast majority of the nation was Ruthenyan, whom did not identify as Lithuanians. Now two Ruthenian states rises from the Ashes, and the nearby nations have taken their slice. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar0.t;The Altai question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar0.d;Ever since the treaty of Nerchinsk, the Altai region has always been in our interest. Rich in Gold, Silver and Copper, the only blocking factor stopping our prospectors has been the Altai Uriankhai host and the Buyeo overlords. However, a brewing leadership crisis has posed an opportunity for us. \n\n The Altai host has lost its Noyon and the Tuvan horde seek to expand their terf. Standard horde shenanigans. But the fact that some Taijis of the Uriankhai have asked us for help changes everything. If we intervene now, this means war with the Buyeo. But this might be an opportunity to further expand our interests, especially in the TransBaikal region. Do we intervene?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar1.t;The Altai question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar1.d;News from the Altai mountains have shocked the court. Apparently, the Tuvans have layed claim to the Altai Uriankhai's lands-and the Uriankhai have asked the Russians for help before us! Although the Tuvan arrogance needs to be punished, the first and formost question is how to deal with the Russians. Do we acknowledge their influence over the Altai region, or do we risk war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar2.t;Buyeo demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar2.d;The Buyeo have demanded us to leave the Altai region immediately. Do we buckle, or do we use this opportunity to claim the Baikal region from the Mongol host once and for all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar3.t;The Buyeo approve our actions!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar3.d;Unexpected news from the South has come. Apparently, the Buyeo approve of our actions and agree to punish the Tuvan intrusion! While the diplomats try to cover the reality in as pompous terms as possible, all political advisors agree that this is just an acknowledgement of their loss of control. The Altai is ours! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar4.t;The Russians evacuate the Altai!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar4.d;As expected, the Northern barbarians have evacuated the Altai! The Empire celebrates today!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar5.t;Lake Balkash trading rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar5.d;Large, narrow, and slightly saline, lake Balkash has always been a trading hub for the nomads roaming eastern Kazakhstan. Since we have annexed the Juz, our traders have regularly visited the cities around the lake. Apparently, that seems to have angered the locals. \n\n A few weeks ago, reports emerged that the local Khoshut Oirat population has murdered three Russian traders. The nation is enraged, and demands immediate retaliation. Should we send our demands of trading rights around Lake Balkash to the Buyeo?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar6.t;Lake Balkash trading rights;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar6.d;Large, narrow, and slightly saline, lake Balkash has always been a trading hub for the nomads roaming eastern Kazakhstan. Since the Russians annexed the Juz, Russian traders have regularly visited the cities around the lake. Apparently, that seems to have angered the locals. \n\n A few weeks ago, reports emerged that the local Khoshut Oirat population has murdered three Russian traders. Using that event as justification that we have lost control over the region, Russia now demands that we hand over sovereignty of the region immediately. Do we risk war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar7.t;Buyeo refusal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar7.d;As expected, the Buyeo have refused our requests. But do we risk war to enforce our demands?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar8.t;Buyeo acceptance;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar8.d;As expected, the Buyeo have accepted our requests. Let us build the fort of Veliny to secure our rule over the region!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar9.t;The Russians back down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar9.d;As expected, the Russians have backed down. Our rule is supreme!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar10.t;The treaty of Yarkand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar10.d;As expected, our troops have handidly beaten the Buyeo. In Yarkand the diplomats gather, and in the end we enforce most of our demands. The area near lake Balkash is ceded to us, and the rest of Xinjiang is partitioned between our Kashgarian puppet, Buyeo Mongolia and the rump state of Xinjiang under nominal Buyeo protection. Let us build the fort of Veliny to secure our rule over the region!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar11.t;The Russians seize Kashgaria!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar11.d;The treaty of Yarkand is concluded, and the Russians have enforced their demands. The area near lake Balkash is ceded to Russia, and the rest of Xinjiang is partitioned between the Russian Kashgar puppet, Our Mongolia and the rump state of Xinjiang under our protection. Where do we go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar12.t;The treaty of Yarkand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar12.d;Unexpectedly, our troops have been beaten by the Buyeo. In Yarkand the diplomats gather, and in the end the Buyeo enforce most of their demands. The Xinjiang border is agreed upon in favor of the Buyeo,and the Mongol territory that we have seized in the last war needs to be returned. Where do we go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar13.t;The treaty of Yarkand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar13.d;As expected, our troops have beaten the Russians. In Yarkand the diplomats gather, and in the end we enforce most of our demands. The Xinjiang border is agreed upon in favor of the locals,and the Mongol territory that the Russians have seized in the last war needs to be returned. This is yet another victory for the Empire!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar14.t;The Mongolian crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar14.d;Throughout the First and second Oirat wars, the Mongols have staunch vassals of the Buyeo. That seems to be changing. With Siberia growing faster and faster, our economic reach over the Mongol hinterlands have strengthened to the point where we can challenge Buyeo influence. \n\n Seizing this moment, some tribes friendly to us have openly called for independence, and demand our help! We shall send our diplomats over to the Buyeo to discuss the matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar15.t;The Mongolian crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar15.d;Throughout the First and second Oirat wars, the Mongols have staunch vassals to our Emperor. That seems to be changing. With Siberia growing faster and faster, Russian economic reach over the Mongol hinterlands have strengthened to the point where they challenge our influence. \n\n Seizing this moment, some tribes friendly to the Russians have openly called for independence, and have even demanded their help! Not being ones to lose this kind of opportunity, the Russian diplomats have asked us to recognize the Mongols as a co-dominion between us two, but stricter control under them. How do we respond?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar16.t;Diplomatic channels break down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar16.d;As with all events past the Urals, the Mongolian crisis has developed faster than we can get reports of. Apparently, those incompetant fools we sent as diplomats have demanded all of Mongolia to be under our control, and the Buyeo have somewhat understandably refused. If we back down now, this would go down as a humiliating event, but going to war would signal that we will back up every call they make to our jingoist far east governors. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar17.t;An unintended victory in the far east;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar17.d;As with all events past the Urals, the Mongolian crisis has developed faster than we can get reports of. Apparently, those jingoist fools we sent as diplomats have demanded all of Mongolia to be under our control, and the Buyeo have somehow accepted our demands! Now we need to make some tough decisions. Who do we appoint to govern the Mongols and the Oirats, and how do we control him?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
Muwar18.t;Moscow rescinds its diplomats;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar18.d;After we have refused demands from the Russians, news from the west show that this was the right call to make. Apparently, those diplomats have worked outside of official protocal, demanding more from us in search of valor for themselves. Russia has apologized, and promises for more cordial relations between us. While we need more information to figure out what incompetance has led to this, one thing is sure. The Russian far east is full of expansionists, and only vigilant action can stop them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar19.t;Deciding the treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar19.d;The war has been won, and we should decide the terms for the war. Originally the war was for the control of the Mongolian horde, so that must be in the terms. However, our jingoistic eastern governors demand more-they seek to take outer Manchuria, lands outside of the Amur and Ussuri rivers, with the port of Hesam included. While seizing Hesam would be a great boon to our eastern provinces, giving yet again to their suggestions might convey a wrong message to our jingoist officers in the military. Do we take the city?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar20.t;The treaty of Hesam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar20.d;The war has been lost, and the terms are brutal. Trading rights, control over Mongolia, land concessions, there isn't a single line that was decided in favor of us. Now, even our homelands of Manchuria are under threat. Where do we go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar21.t;The treaty of Hesam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar21.d;The treaty of Hesam is concluded, and the Buyeo have enforced their demands. Mongolia is decided to be firmely in their control, and the Stanovoy border is agreed in favor of them. A setback, for sure, but we can recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar22.t;The treaty of Hesam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar22.d;The treaty of Hesam is concluded, and our demands are included. Mongolia is decided to be firmely in our control, and the Stanovoy border is agreed in favor of us. A minor victory in comparison to our prior defeats, but a victory nonetheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar23.t;TransBaikal is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar23.d;The war is concluded, and TransBaikal is ours! The Mongol host is pushed south, and our claims over the region is absolute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar24.t;Russians seize TransBaikal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar24.d;The war is concluded, and the Mongols are punished for our failures. The Russians take the TransBaikal, and the Mongols are understandably furious. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar25.t;The Buyeo demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar25.d;The war is concluded, and the Buyeo return south. The Mongols claim the disputed lands around TransBaikal, and the Altai are free. Was the whole endeavor worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar26.t;TransBaikal secured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar26.d;The war is concluded, and we return south. The Mongols claim the disputed lands around TransBaikal, and the Altai are free. The Barbarians are defeated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar27.t;Dummy event!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Muwar27.d;i wouldn't say freed more like under new management;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Moroc0.t;Imported supplies from Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Moroc0.d;As the civil war rages on, we need more supplies then ever. Thankfully, our orders from the Granadans have arrived;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Moroc1.t;Build the city of Nouadhibou;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Moroc1.d;In the Mauritanian region, cities are few and far between. As such, with minimal investment we can build our center for the region, putting the entirety of Mauritania under our influence. The small fishing village of Nouadhibou seems like the perfect candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Moroc2.t;Conquest of Inner Mauritania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Moroc2.d;Inner mauritania must be subjugated if we seek to truly rule Mauritania. As such, we shall send our best soldiers and diplomats to the Berber tribes. They will recognize our sovereignty, once and for all. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lossAlg.t;Loss of connection to Algeria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lossAlg.d;After the fall of Tunisia, Our connection to our Algerian tribes have been severed. Sensing an opportunity, they have risen up, demanding an Algerian to rule over them. As we lack any means to respond, all we can do is sit and watch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Pearlflood0.t;The Pearl River Floods;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Pearlflood0.d;Located on the South of our nation, the Pearl river is one of the longest and largest river in our empire. Flowing in the lands of the Liangguang, the region was recently pacified of rebels. However, our administration hasn't settled in yet. A potentially devastating fact, now that the river has flooded. Thousands of mu of farmland are devastated, and the region is demanding help from us. Quick action must be taken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Pearlflood1.t;Plague and famine spreads;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Pearlflood1.d;Our devastated provinces in the south are reporting nothing but horrible news. Water-spread diseases are spreading rapidly, and the region is running out of rice. There are already reports of people dying on the streets-and our relief efforts are nowhere to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Pearlflood2.t;The south calms down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Pearlflood2.d;The harvests have finally returned to their required numbers, and the epidemics are burning themselves out. We paid a terrible price for this, but the Pearl river region is returning to normalcy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
taiwanopium0.t;Taiwan found as source of Opium;;;;;;;;;;;;;
taiwanopium0.d;Our appointment of Lin Zexu have found significant foundings. The recent flood of Opium in The Yangtse delta originates from the island of Taiwan! \n\n Occupied by rebels and merchants fleeing the war in Bokgun, they have been allured by the riches of the opium trade and since have been sending caskets after caskets in their iconic red junks to our ports. If it wasn't the clean and conscientious Lin zexu, this collusion of merchants and corrupt officials would have been never found! Already there are calls within court to start an expedition to Taiwan and see those peddlers be punished. We must act decisively!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Crimeaw0.t;The Crimean Khanate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw0.d;If there is any nation that has been the greates existential threat to Russia, it is the Crimean Khanate. Until we teached them a lesson they will never forget at the battle of Kinburn, They devastated Russian and Lithuanian Ruthenia. Now, as fortifications at the Azov near completion, we have a unique opportunity for us to drive in the final nail in the Crimean coffin. The question is, do we ally with the Lithuanians for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw1.t;The Russian offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw1.d;The Russians have come to us with a secret offer; They offer us Odessa if we join in their coming war with Crimea. While ending the Crimean Khanate is quite the prospect, are we sure it is better with the Russians expanding at their expense?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw2.t;The Lithuanians agree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw2.d;As expected, the Lithuanians have agreed to our offers of Odessa for their army. Now, we march South!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw3.t;The Lithuanians refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw3.d;The Lithuanians have refused, probably wary of our expansion. They do not know we can do without them. Now, we march South!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw4.t;Victory over Crimea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw4.d;The Turkish intervention forces retreat over the sea. Now, the Crimeans are at our mercy-and we seem to be out of it. The territories shall be incorporated into guvernorates, and the land shall be open for Russian colonization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw5.t;Victory over Crimea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw5.d;The Turkish intervention forces retreat over the sea. Now, the Crimeans are at our mercy-and we seem to be out of it. The territories shall be incorporated into guvernorates, and the land shall be open for Russian colonization. Of course, The Odessan region goes to the Lithuanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw6.t;Beaten back from Crimea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Crimeaw6.d;While we haven't lost land, we spent so much blood for so little. How did we lose? Where do we go from here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw0.t;The Georgian Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw0.d;Interesting news has arrived from Georgia. The Ruling prince Dmitri Bagration has been ousted, and the Mukhrani branch has taken over! Prince Bagration wants his lands back, and he has come to us with an offer. He offers us steadfast loyalty if we manage to oust Ivane Mukhrani and protect him from Turkish interference. But do we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw1.t;The Russians are in Georgia!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Georgiaw1.d;There has been a palace coup in Georgia, and the Russians seem like they won't let this opportunity to go to waste. They have invaded from the north, with the exiled prince at their helm.

BuyAZV1.d;As we work our way into Azov, we have a decision to make;" Whom do we contact for its purchace? The City is nominally owned by the Farenikte, a collection of Jewish settlements. They are a workable folk, but will drive a hard bargain for one of their own cities. Alternatively, we could seek ""help"" from their nominal protectors, the Venetians. With their silence, we could simply demand the settlement outright. Of course, that would be a threatening act, but money is money...";;;;;;;;;;;;

JAPsupplies0.t;The Disaster in Kyushu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies0.d;Kyushu has been hit hard by typhoons this summer, yet the convoluted bakufu led by the old shogun seems to be just fine letting the peasants die. The Sangiin of Merchants have decided that we might have to intervene to save the peasants. While this may be technically interfering in the business of the daimyo of Hyuga no Kuni, what harm could a fleet of rice do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies1.t;The Disaster in Kyushu;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPsupplies1.d;A flurry of reports come from the port of Kagoshima. First, it indicated that the merchant confederation in the southerly isles of Sainantan have sent us a ship of grain to mitigate our severe typhoon season. Then, news came that the samurai bureaucrats of the port and the Sainantan merchants came to a brawl. Next, a Samurai had struck down a merchant with his rights of Kiri-sute gomen for insolence. Finally, there was a battle between the fleets sailors and the port garrison, and our garrison seem to have lost to their superior weapons? \n\n Quick dialogue between cooler heads have stopped this from leading to an acutal war, but the news has shocked the isles. How could have a mob of merchants beaten true Samurai? Do we have to take a look into their weapons?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Bunminkounou0.t;Daimin gokuo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bunminkounou0.d;The Emperor's words have kicked off discussion after discussion in the streets. A new brand of scholars calling themselves Civil Confucians have openly talked about how the peasants, farmers, and merchants could have their delegates advise samurai. In response, more and more samurai are responding in violence to silence the upstarts. \n\n While the movement remains minor, we should keep an eye on them. Just for security. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bunminkounou1.t;$PROVINCENAME$ Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bunminkounou1.d;Terrible news from $PROVINCENAME$! A group of samurai have attacked public speakers carrying the banner of Bunmin kounou!

Bunminkounou2.d;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to study and learn from our southern colony of Sainantan of their ways of managing the economy, the society and even their politics. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, is a challenge to the Kyogoku shogunate's power, and may serve to further incite rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;

JAPconstitution0.t;A modern constitution for a modern Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPconstitution0.d;After our victory over the Tokugawa, we are poised to enact a new constitution never tried before in Asia. \n\n Borrowing Heavily from nations such as Venice and the Akino league, this legislation seeks to guarentee equal rights for all peasants to be heard by the emperor. While there are simmers of reactionaries in the countryside, we have shown our military might during the war-no one would want to challenge us again. \n\n Right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPconstitution1.t;Rural areas in open revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
JAPconstitution1.d;Terrible news from $PROVINCENAME$! The rural gentry are activly defying and even hindering our efforts of constitutional reform, calling it the Shizan kenpo(The Stillborn constitution) and seeking to replace it by return to tradition. Worse, even the peasantry supposed to support us are at best disturbed at the rapid pace of change. Time will be needed for the rural regions to be stable again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar0.t;The Formosa Question;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar0.d;The recent murder of Japanese sailors off the coast of Formosa has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war? Are the risks of Chinese intervention reasonable?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar1.t;The Formosa Question;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar1.d;The Japanese have come to us with a demand. Apparently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ subjects have killed Japanese sailors on Formosa, and they demand us to transfer sovereignty of the island immediatly. This will mean war if we refuse... What do we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
Taiwanwar2.t;Formosan offers;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar2.d;Formosa has been a quasai-independent state after our conquest of Fujian. The Formosans paid lip service as a province under us, and we haven't bothered to ratify their vassalige. Today, the Formosans ask us for help-apparently the Japanese seek to conquear them? They offer to be an official vassal under our emperor in exchange for military assistance. But do we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar3.t;Buyeo intervention;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar3.d;As expected, the Buyeo have intervened in affairs between us and Formosa. They will pay for this insolence. ;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar4.t;The Treaty of Shimonoseki;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar4.d;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not going well. The damnable Japanese are in our lands and blockading our ports, and to the embarrassment of our government there seems to be little we can do to stop them. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached us to negotiate a 'fair' settlement -- hand over Formosa and pay reparations. While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them what they want, though the loss to our prestige would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar5.t;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;
Taiwanwar5.d;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us Formosa as well as reparations. This has improved relations between our countries tremendously, and should go a long way to ensuring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Asia remains strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;

SLAVETRADE;"The Atlantic slave trade, transatlantic slave trade, or Euro-American slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of various enslaved African people, mainly to the Americas. The slave trade regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were people from Central and West Africa that had been sold by other West Africans to Western European slave traders, while others had been captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids;[4] Europeans gathered and imprisoned the enslaved at forts on the African coast and then brought them to the Americas." ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME510000;The Last Xochitl;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC510000;The Tlaxcalan king, Maxtla Xochitl V, has died at the ripe old age of 79. This would not be worth mentioning if he had heirs, but sadly, he does not, for the barbarous Nahua killed his then 27 year old son in the last great war between our peoples, a war his son only instigated out of grief at the mysterious tasting Nahua corn Maxtla V's grandson last swallowed before he died of some illness. With Maxtla V's body perishes the honorable family that defended us unwaveringly since the humiliating defeat we suffered at the hands of the Nahua ingrates' rebellion. More tragic still, their petty kingdom was all that shielded our great cities of Enekoatlan and Iruna Berea from direct Nahua ambitions. We would keep them as a puppet, but the royal court has no spare sons. All Zakatlan citizens knew this day would happen, yet it is still painful to imagine, our last vassal has finally been annexed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME510001;The Mestizo Gateway;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC510001;Finally, the traitor to the fatherland, the vile Maxtla Xochitl V, has died. While the dishonorable deaths of his son and grandson were humiliating and controversial amongst our people, it cannot be denied that he more than earned it and that these underhanded tactics contributed greatly to his descent into despair fueled madness. More importantly, with his passing, his lands have been directly annexed into the horrid white state's patrimony. With no vassal treaties to worry about now, this leaves us a golden opportunity to easily march into the Mestizos' foul mountain strongholds and rid our beautiful native lands of their half-white taint once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC510002;What was widely believed to be inevitable has finally happened.

We are not disheartened by this news! On the contrary, we welcome it! We yearn to avenge our humiliation by them all those years ago, and we yearn to reverse their desires. We will return to Tenotxtitlan and make it Basque and Christian again, and we will turn this paradise into a land of half-europeans, by any means necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
